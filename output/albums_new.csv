Logo,Meltdown,70,A below par effort by their high standards.
Logo,Happiness In Magazines,90,"The defining characteristic of Happiness In Magazines isn't its full sound, nor its sharp reminder of what a great band Blur used to be; its in the sheer imaginative scope."
Logo,Homesongs,80,"Nothing less than a whole new world will do, and Adem has created just that."
Logo,Scissor Sisters,90,The key is - unlike the tongue-in-cheek cock-rock of The Darkness and the running joke of Electric Six - Scissor Sisters are reverential to the sounds of the 70's.
Logo,One Soul Now,60,"It most probably won't attract new fans, but Margo Timmins' voice is as unique as Thalia Zedek's, for example, and remains their greatest asset."
Logo,Drill A Hole In That Substrate And Tell Me What You See,80,"His mumbled burr recalls that half-awake state where reality melts, a strain of Southern Gothic best listened to at 3am with a half-empty bottle of bourbon and all the lights on."
Logo,Uh Huh Her,100,"From the start, she's made an ideal record for people who already like her."
Logo,Modern Apprentice,90,"Quite simply, this is the most invigorating album released in recent times and definitely one for the collection."
Logo,Auf Der Maur,80,"Though Auf Der Maur has run off with their blueprint and built it as seen, there's raw passion and no little class here; Corgan and Love must be rueing their luck."
Logo,Sung Tongs,90,This is what you get when you give an overactive imagination the space to expand; it's indescribably perfect.
Logo,Devin Dazzle And The Neon Fever,80,Felix Da Housecat's shift into the wastelands of punk- funk and No Wave has given 'Devin Dazzle And The Neon Fever' the feel of an excursion into virgin territory.
Logo,Achilles Heel,80,"Bazan will never sound truly happy on record, but here he's as content as anyone could have hoped for, and all the healthier for it."
Logo,The Greater Wrong Of The Right,80,"The names Pitchshifter, Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein are often bandied about in this company, but here's a tip: Skinny Puppy have rendered them once again irrelevant."
Logo,Vol 3: (The Subliminal Verses),70,"A significant broadening of the tonal spectrum notwithstanding, the outfit manages to keep their ferocity intact, although the malevolence is structured with a shrewd infusion of melodic vocals, flourishing experimental dynamics and a motherlode of striking riffs."
Logo,Faded Seaside Glamour,80,"It isn't the place of a debut to straddle styles as diverse as harmony-drenched 60's beat-soul, the shoegazing sound-paintings of the 80's and relaxed futurism of now, yet this is their debut, and it covers all this and more."
Logo,Now Here Is Nowhere,60,"Unfortunately there are only flashes of Curtis breaking free of the overwhelming dominance of their prog tendencies. When used sparingly they are rich and absorbing, but in these instances they lack impact."
Logo,Split The Difference,40,"Unfortunately, whereas sounding out of place in the late 90s worked in their favour, in the mid-noughties the lack of pretty faces, Converse Allstars and - perhaps most important of all - any half-decent tunes is unlikely to bring Gomez first prize even in their local pub's battle of the bands."
Logo,You Are The Quarry,70,Even a half good Morrissey album is streets ahead of the competition.
Logo,Up At The Lake,80,Their most accomplished album to date.
Logo,Don't Climb On And Take The Holy Water,80,"This is music best heard in the dark, on your back."
Logo,C'Mon Miracle,70,"Mirah's ability to paste candy-pop nursery rhymes over voluptuous, macabre arrangements is truly unique and wholly un-matched."
Logo,Rejoicing In The Hands,90,It's as simple as songwriting can get; as striking as songwriting can get.
Logo,Summer Make Good,80,"Catching electronica in it's embryonic state and somehow fusing it together with lush folk stylings, weathered ambience and the slightest - most beautiful - trace of vocals 'Summer Makes Good' is a truly breath-taking record."
Logo,Absent Friends,40,Patchy at best.
Logo,Van Lear Rose,90,Perhaps the album of her career.
Logo,Musicology,80,"A collection of frisky funk, slinky soul, raucous R&B and heated rock 'n' roll based on real songs, rather than the doodles and sketches that have recently become the norm."
Logo,Faking The Books,80,"If invention and imagination are the criteria to judge, this is a future classic."
Logo,The Runaway Found,90,The Veils debut is a colossal - yet strangely intimate - record.
Logo,The Duel,80,By far her best yet.
Logo,Schoozzzmmii,70,A window into the sublime mind of one of Britain's great outsiders.
The A.V. Club,Black Panther: The Album,83,"It all works, really. The tracks play it safe, but the project itself does not, an audacious exertion of energy from one of the planet's most universally revered musicians."
The A.V. Club,Crooked Shadows,50,"Of all his very short albums, this is his shortest, and where he once packed his songs with knotty chord changes and shout-along confessions, here he tends toward conventional structures and lowest-common-denominator couplets."
The A.V. Club,Sleepwalkers,75,"It's just Fallon and his microphone, crooning and crowing over these rhythm and blues-focused rave-ups, holding court over an old-school rock revival to match his restless mood."
The A.V. Club,Brighter Wounds,83,Brighter Wounds poses more questions than answers--but that uncertainty only makes the record more absorbing.
The A.V. Club,Always Ascending,67,"Always Ascending has its moments, even if it's not the musical rebirth Franz Ferdinand sought."
The A.V. Club,Here Come the Runts,83,The variety of genres here impresses the most.
The A.V. Club,Criminal,75,"While that poetry-journal melodrama grows a tad exhausting by album's end, there are plenty of deliciously bitter pleasures here for anyone who similarly loves brooding in that blacked-out, candlelit bedroom of the mind."
The A.V. Club,Microshift,75,"Overall, Microshift is the sound of a band pulling itself out of the abyss on the back of its most buoyant music yet."
The A.V. Club,Blood,91,"It's more minimal than The xx, more romantic than the most heartsick R&B, with drums pulled straight from '70s studio sessions. In other words, it's a lot of things, while still sounding like nothing else out there."
The A.V. Club,Man of the Woods,67,"Unfortunately, Man Of The Woods' thematic depth hasn't quite caught up to the rest of his ambition. It's not a fatal flaw, but it does make for a record that's not quite as transcendent as it was built up to be."
The A.V. Club,Down Below,83,"The title and lyrics suggest an inferno worthy of Dante, but music this simultaneously hooky and heavy could only have been concocted north of hell."
The A.V. Club,Shape the Future,50,"With so much New Age nattering, here more than ever your enjoyment will depend on your own zeal for enlightenment and/or bong rips."
The A.V. Club,All Melody,91,"A vibrant, exploratory album born from Frahm's newly constructed Berlin studio and the freedom to experiment it allowed."
The A.V. Club,Snares Like a Haircut,83,"Snares Like A Haircut finds Dean Spunt and Randy Randall making a warm, self-assured reunion, with each other and that scene-leading musical style."
The A.V. Club,Mania,50,"Since around 2007's Infinity On High, the key to enjoying Fall Out Boy has been letting go of their pop-punk past and embracing the pop band that always hid in plain sight. That was a chore on American Beauty/American Psycho, but less so on Mania. As endorsements go, that's pretty qualified."
The A.V. Club,Semicircle,67,"It's a rousing party record, but when the music stops and the lights come on, it all blurs together into a fun but forgettable time."
The A.V. Club,I Like Fun,75,"Lake Monsters gives rocking sci-fi tribute to mysterious beasts that should please longtime fans, 'The Bright Side' borrows from the '60s British Invasion, and 'Push Back The Hands' also turns sweetly nostalgic though there's no need for looking backward just yet, as the TMBG song machine is still operating at full force."
The A.V. Club,The  Official Body,83,"The Official Body proves why it's remained durable over so many iterations and, for the London trio, across three albums. There's a directness to its pleasures that's unflagging for all 10 tracks here."
The A.V. Club,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,83,"It may lack the punch of Nikki Nack, but for those willing to hang around and appreciate its jammier approach, it's a cathartic, worthwhile stop along the Tune-Yards catalog."
The A.V. Club,The House,50,"Maine turns in some of his best songs yet, with 'Country,' 'Now The Water,' and 'Find Me' all showcasing his skill as a crooner, but around its midpoint, the album starts to sag. The House's three interludes feel less like connective tissue and more like unfinished filler, and the album's back half ends up seeming rote."
The A.V. Club,Ruins,75,"It's a very familiar take on Americana, full of heartbreak and yearning, but a damn reliable one."
The A.V. Club,P'OST-,91,While that sounds incredibly daunting--and like a really tiring listen--the album's most impressive trait is that it makes all that vital work feel joyous and communal.
The A.V. Club,No One Ever Really Dies,58,"It's a weird fucking album, in other words, neither as crowd-pleasing as it should be nor as experimental as it wants to be. The drums sound great, though, and the Rihanna track is as good as N.E.R.D. gets."
The A.V. Club,Saturation III,75,"Like its predecessors, the album is hit or miss, but the batting average remains uncommonly high for a project like this."
The A.V. Club,Revival,33,"Revival isn't even interesting enough to warrant all of the critical beatdowns it's taken in its short time in the world. Instead, it's boring and predictable, which are greater threats to the Eminem legacy than anything else."
The A.V. Club,Finding Shore,83,"If the actual product doesn't always measure up to that quirky ingenuity--or if it is, on the whole, just a touch too chamber-music stately to reach the mind-expanding heights of Eno's '70s and '80s team-ups with Robert Fripp, Cluster, Harold Budd, et al.--Finding Shore still contains moments that are plenty interesting, even downright beautiful. In those, it doesn't really matter how they were created."
The A.V. Club,"How to Solve Our Human Problems, Pt. 1 [EP]",75,"What stands out about the first entry in Belle & Sebastian's three-part EP series How To Solve Our Human Problems is how much it, like 2015's Girls In Peacetime Want To Dance, sounds like the work of an out-and-out band."
The A.V. Club,The Visitor,42,"Young and the youngsters he's playing with here sound like they wrote and jammed these songs out in a few days, relying on the strength of his sentiment to carry them through. But a jam session with some cranky speak-singing on it doesn't make for a great album, and it's not going to make any new converts, unfortunately--either to Neil Young's politics or his music."
The A.V. Club,"From a Room, Vol. 2",91,"Stapleton's gravelly vocals sell his own openly emotive songs like no one else could, the poetic imagery in tracks like 'Scarecrow In The Garden' transcending typical beer-and-babes fodder."
The A.V. Club,War & Leisure,83,"Miguel wears War & Leisure's looseness well, and even if he doesn't reveal much of himself, he still has the charisma to pull the whole ensemble off."
Exclaim,Loma,80,"Loma is also the product of atypical conditions, written and recorded as the marriage of two of its members was dissolving. The trio seem to have leaned in to that situation: Loma captures the intimacy of such heightened circumstance with layered, compelling nuance."
Exclaim,In a Poem Unlimited,90,"Groovy and scintillating, but with depth and meaning to spare, In a Poem Unlimited is U.S. Girls--and pop music--at its very best."
Exclaim,What a Time to Be Alive,80,"Thirty years deep into their career, Superchunk throw yet another left turn into a career full of them, offering up a protest record about the people for the people. What a time to be alive, indeed."
Exclaim,Make Way for Love,90,"The singer elicited production help from Noah Georgeson ( Joanna Newsom, Devendra Banhart), a smart decision, given the subtle yet always effective sonic touches here. The result is a stunning work that will draw you back to repeated, if oft intense, listening."
Exclaim,Dead Start Program,70,"Dead Start Program as another dependable collection of quality techno that will satisfy his fan base, even if it fails to bring in new ears."
Exclaim,Clone of the Universe,70,"Due to the first half's measly runtime (half of its high octane songs clock in at under three minutes) and heavy as hell ending, listening to Clone of the Universe kind of feels like visiting a tapas bar with a few friends, only to drunkenly venture off at the end of the night to slam down a whole duck, solo (and no, that's not a euphemism): it's a journey most would avoid making, but a compelling one for those willing to roll the dice and ride."
Exclaim,Room Inside the World,70,"Ought are moving forward on Room Inside the World, adding new elements to their sound while largely retaining the tension that makes the band so compelling."
Exclaim,Crooked Shadows,60,"It was always going to be tough for Dashboard Confessional to repeat what they were, but while maybe Crooked Shadows doesn't hit the heights that A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar did in 2003, it's still a welcome return."
Exclaim,Legend of the Seagullmen,70,Fans of Mastodon's swamp prog and Tool's art-school alternative will find plenty to like.
Exclaim,Little Dark Age,70,"Its first half features some of the group's sweetest pop confections since those massive singles, while its second delves into the muggy Barrett-isms of their more recent work."
Exclaim,Always Ascending,70,"Not everything lands with the same emphasis as the album's opening moments, but there are enough quality moments across ten tracks--how ""Lois Lane"" frames the horrors of the ""over 30 singles night"" at its chorus, the disco drive of ""Glimpse of Love,"" the mid-song sax run of ""Feel the Love Go""--to suggest this transformation in sound has yet to reach its peak."
Exclaim,Sleepwalkers,50,"Sleepwalkers has some very good songs, but often comes off as cheesy and predictable--if a melody sounds familiar, it's probably because Fallon has sung one just like it before."
Exclaim,Con Todo El Mundo,80,"Atmospheric grooves is the order of the day with Khruangbin's latest; by way of psychedelic rock, Con Todo El Mundo's got the groove and grips it tight."
Exclaim,Starcrawler,70,"There's nothing truly radical about the collection, but it is gratifying riff-based rock, and in an industry littered with sycophants, Starcrawler's brand of exuberant noise is refreshing. The future may be bright for these young guns."
Exclaim,Messes,80,"Never too bitter or too sweet, these songs are bursting at the seams with casual urgency, an intoxicating counterpoint to the songs' melancholy."
Exclaim,Quit the Curse,70,"The leisurely pace of  ""In Your Dreams"" is too soporific, while ""Yeah You Know"" lacks the punctuation that needs to accompany Burch when she resigns to ""go out west a while."" Despite this dilution at times, Bruch still burns bright on Quit the Curse."
Exclaim,Criminal,80,"Most of the risks he takes on Criminal pay off, and the record is among his most confident statements as an artist."
Exclaim,Man of the Woods,50,"Immaculately produced and performed, it's hard to imagine Man of the Woods not being a hit, its tracks a steady stream for playlist fodder. But sound and feel are no substitute for soul."
Exclaim,Resolve,70,"Poppy Ackroyd chooses to move at a efficiently percussive pace throughout (best highlighted by the fertile and aptly-named ""Time""), giving the album a post-modern atmosphere rarely explored on many classical-inspired albums, making Resolve an album hard to pin down and hard to categorize, but easy to adore."
Exclaim,Lionheart,80,"When Olsen sings, the record takes on an ephemeral sad-in-a-good way vibe, Merritt's and Gustafson's voices also blend with McEntire's terrifically, making Lionheart enjoyable on the level of a record of country duets as well."
Exclaim,Pissing Stars,80,"It is intimate and alienating; friendly and mysterious; and, most importantly, a whole lot of eerie fun for any listener interested in experimental music."
Exclaim,Culture II,60,"Having more songs available to stream results in more royalties, though it doesn't equate to a flawless full-length."
Exclaim,Full Circle Nightmare,70,"Each song is theatrically arranged with Craft belting like a Broadway star and the large band supporting his every word. The ebbs and flows become slightly predictable near the end of the album, but Craft does a terrific job of performing the songs, emoting and propelling his tales with vigour."
Exclaim,Blood,90,"A near-perfect record. ... Blood flows with humanity, an exploration of diverse cultures, sounds and sensibilities. Rhye reveals that it is in tune with itself and inhabits a world that feels distant and inclusive at once."
Exclaim,Rifles and Rosary Beads,90,"Exquisite. ... Rifles & Rosary Beads offers not only a document of atrocity and neglect, but a chance for redemption and healing."
Exclaim,Open Here,80,"Field Music have created a truly immersive record with Open Here, one that is welcoming, conversational and oh-so-necessary for a world experiencing daily fear and paranoia."
Exclaim,Down Below,80,"Save somewhat of a flat end, Down Below is a great metal album that blends multiple genres into a perfectly idiosyncratic sound that should bring Tribulation much success and attention."
Exclaim,Les Fleurs du Mal,70,Folks hoping for a repeat of Rabit's 2015 pseudo-grime offering Communion will certainly be disappointed here; open-minded listeners with a penchant for the darker side of experimental dance music will find their thirst for evil slaked.
Exclaim,Freedom's Goblin,80,"Freedom's Goblin cuts open Segall's brain and lets it all ooze out. Serve yourself up a spoonful of all that melodic goo, and enjoy."
Exclaim,Shape the Future,70,"What was once something to blast on your bedroom speakers is now crying out for a live performance with a nine-piece band, which, if nothing else, shows a maturity in sound."
The 405,Silver Dollar Moment,75,"Much of the record maintains a high tempo in line with the singles released so far, but interestingly it's the one real downer that provides the album's standout moment."
The 405,Transangelic Exodus,80,"Careful attention to details grounds the story and makes it believable. You know, insomuch as a tale of transangels can be believable."
The 405,A Humdrum Star,75,A Humdrum Star is largely successful and in a perfect world will be just one of a great many formal experiments for the band.
The 405,Blood,80,Some bands are lucky and talented enough to find a format that works and just make hay with it. Rhye are plainly in love with their formula on Blood. The result is a finely balanced gem.
The 405,Brighter Wounds,70,Where Brighter Wounds works best is when the band shows an element of restraint.
The 405,Go Dig My Grave,80,"Regardless of its leanings towards the descents into gloom, Go Dig My Grave retains a gorgeous edge, Susanna's vocals are alluring as ever, on one of her most unique projects to date."
The 405,Microshift,90,"In some ways, Microshift is Hookworms' equivalent of that album [Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion]. A band with an established sound embracing electronics and pop songwriting like never before, but managing to do so without it feeling remotely forced, and finding their biggest audience yet as a result."
The 405,Dream Wife,75,"Dream Wife is an album inextricably linked with the band's own youthful energy, as it is projected from every single guitar lick, vocal tick and musical explosion across its 35 minutes. This can prove a little wearing or agitating for those not in the right state of mind, as their brand of pop-rock is some of the most invasive and bolshy likely to be heard on a debut album. However, if you're looking for an aural caffeine kick, a rock and roll sugar rush or an emphatic 'I don't give a fuck!' then look no further."
The 405,Criminal,80,"Despite the album adopting a confessional structure, the characteristic elements of The Soft Moon's aggression remains. And it all sounds dirtier, gritter and angrier than ever."
The 405,Messes,75,"Messes is an album that's likely to fly under the radar, as it is being released into a field that's already crowded. But, anyone that gives it a chance is likely to get Stef Chura's idiosyncratic vocals hooked to their brain, and will be enticed to give it more time. It will only reward further listens, as the subtleties in this simplistic joy are many."
The 405,Pissing Stars,70,"At the end of the day, this is a compelling addition to the Constellation ouvre, and there's plenty to love here for fans of any moment of Menuck's wonderful last 20+ years in recorded music."
The 405,Man of the Woods,35,"'Haters gonna say it's fake,' Timberlake frankly asserts on, 'Filthy'. They needn't even bother. Genuine or not, it simply doesn't work."
The 405,Culture II,75,"It may well be overwhelming in the moment, but Migos have provided us with a lot to unpack as we await whatever comes next. Chances are, you'll like this album far more after the glut of material becomes a tad less staggering over some months."
The 405,P2,75,"Flashes of sudden genius seem to make up for the spotty manner in which P2 is delivered in, an album that, although hype-worthy and buzzy, fails to make a truly lasting impression. However, if East can bring his same passion along for when he's finally ready to offer his debut proper, we hopefully have something to look forward to."
The 405,Marble Skies,75,"Just about every song on Marble Skies is successful. The unfortunate outlier is 'Surface to Air,' which features Slow Club's Rebecca Taylor on lead vocals. The second track on the album, it's a full-length number that feels like an interlude that outstayed its welcome."
The 405,Snares Like a Haircut,80,"At their peak, and not infrequently on Snares Like a Haircut they're within touching distance, No Age are one of the most thrilling rock bands on this planet."
The 405,Freedom's Goblin,75,"There are tracks on here that will undoubtedly go down in the pantheon of great Ty Segall songs and be taken out on stage to thrill and delight. The rest can be quickly and easily enjoyed, then entirely forgotten about--which doesn't really matter, since we're probably only a year or so away from yet another Ty Segall album."
The 405,Passover,70,"Passover may be an album of grieving, but it is not beholden to the process. While many albums of loss are as hard to hear as they are beautiful, Shields has opted for a somewhat more welcoming approach."
The 405,2 Tha Left,80,"Rarely has an emcee arrived to the hip-hop scene in such a controlled and specific manner. Perico sounds better with each release, building off of his past flaws, topping whatever he had in mind only months prior."
The 405,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,80,Tune-Yards latest is a record dominated by the society it both critiques and is a part of.
The 405,The  Official Body,60,"You can't listen to the music found here without dancing, which is a blessing and a curse. It's fun at first, but eventually you'll need a breather."
The 405,This Is Glue,60,"The production is tidy but one note, the instrumentation resolutely professional. The vocalist has a few touchstones and reverently shifts from one to another without exactly lighting any fires of his own. Back in 1992 they would call this alternative rock."
The 405,The House,70,"The House has moments where it seems like Maine might have said everything he's capable of saying with Porches. However, there are enough positives, particularly around the end, to feel like he's not bled his creativity dry."
The 405,Semicircle,50,"Often the vocal melodies religiously, and simplistically, follow the melody of the lead instrument, leading to a lack of interesting melodic counterpoint and contrast, and, in almost all cases, they're the kind of Sesame Street sing-songy melodies that no one over the age of five would unironically enjoy."
The 405,Songs of Praise,75,"It just sounds like a bunch of young men looking to blow off steam, and that is what makes it such an enjoyable romp."
The 405,Camila,60,"Cabello is finding her footing, and with more swings than misses here, the album signals a hopeful future for a fledgling pop giant."
The 405,Lex,70,"Lex is well-mannered, fun experimentalism with a winning spirit. If it doesn't break any tonal boundaries, it firmly establishes its composers' place at least in sight of the bleeding edge. And it opens the door to all manner of discoveries."
The 405,"Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho",70,"It never reaches for more, and to bludgeon it for achieving its minor ambitions is bizarre practice. It may not leap, but it never stumbles. Calm down, sit back and vibe."
The 405,POST-,85,"As a collective package, POST- is incredibly accomplished. You'll relate--hard--you'll be shook, you'll feel attacked, because this record underlines in red marker some uncomfortable truths which are articulated uproariously. POST- has set an extraordinarily high bar for the rest of punk in 2018 to clear."
The 405,Rainbow Mirror,75,"Rainbow Mirror is immersive, exhausting, and decidedly flawed. However, the strengths are more than enough to carry it forward, and the flaws are just a reminder that Fernow is at his best when he's not holding back."
Kerrang!,Technology,80,"It's 14 tracks of craziness to be embraced and shouted at the rafters. [10 Feb 2018, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Clone of the Universe,80,"The pairing makes more and more sense everytime you listen to it, perfectly rounding off 37 minutes of bubbling, stoned fuzz. [3 Feb 2018, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Legend of the Seagullmen,60,"Epic, bonkers album. [3 Feb 2018, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Sleepwalkers,80,"Light and breezy strummer Her majesty's Service occasionally reads like a string of Fallon-isms (rolling stones, a girl named Elsie, etc.), but it's blown away by the hulking brass of Sleepwalkers, which straddles the line between grandness and outrageousness perfectly. [10 Feb 2018, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Here Come the Runts,40,"Scattershot. [20 Jan 2018, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Down Below,80,"You won't realise you've been possessed til it's too late. [20 Jan 2018, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Hold On To Your Heart,80,"Fantastic album. [27 Jan 2018, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Mania,80,"They're strutting along a tightrope without a downward glance here. [27 Jan 2018, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Knowing What You Know Now,100,"Here you're thrilled by how refreshingly streamlined these songs are from the off. [20 Jan 2018, p.50]"
Kerrang!,The Age of Absurdity,60,"Their diesel-soaked biker rock is an uncomplicated joy. [13 Jan 2018, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Underworld,60,"Occasionally one song simple bleeds into another. ... On the whole, however, Underworld bears the mark of a band redefining who they are and putting themselves back on steady footing after a wobble. [6 Jan 2018, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Vale,80,"Despite throwing some creative curveballs into the mix, Vale feels very much like the rue follow-up to Wretched And Divine, and sees Black Veil Brides writing their own myth once more. [13 Jan 2018, p.50]"
Kerrang!,No Cross No Crown,80,"It's simple stuff, but it's as powerful and unstoppable as an avalanche. [6 Jan 2018, p.54]"
Kerrang!,Asking Alexandria,80,"Danny's back where he belongs, and Asking Alexandria have returned with their boldest record yet. [2 Dec 2017, p.49]"
Kerrang!,From the Fires,60,"This young band sound so eerily similar Led Zeppelin, you wish they'd back off a little. [25 Nov 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Material Control,80,"It's a record that ignores its own decade-long mystique to work on being important on its own merit, through dazzling songcraft and the band's unrivaled ability to pull brightness from the most freakish and inharmonious junctures. [9 Dec 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Master of Puppets [Remastered & Expanded Edition],100,"From the embryonic ideas to the songs' live debuts, it's the ultimate insight into the birth of a world-conquering classic. [11 Nov 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Wizard Bloody Wizard,80,"An album that once again sees Wizard creating a new landscape with only the slightest adjustment. Yeah, it's more rock'n'roll, but it's still ultra-stoned, it's still ultra-heavy, and Electric Wizard still hate[s] you. [25 Nov 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Synthesis,60,"It frequently feels like one of those remix albums where tinkering guests have tried too hard to put their own stamp on proceedings, resulting in curios that are momentarily interesting, but will never replace the established versions in your affections on your playlists. [11 Nov 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Interiors,60,"Propelled by Sergio Vega's springy bass, Walter Schreifels' effortless instantly recognisable vocal floats over everything. [11 Nov 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,American Fall,60,"It's radiant, bold and frequently brilliant. [4 Nov 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,The Dusk in Us,100,"Five years since the release of All We Love We Leave Behind, you could argue this is more of the same and just another Converge album. Pitted against the best of the band's catalogue, though, this one holds its own. [4 Nov 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,The  Canyon,80,"The Canyon showcases a consistent and powerful synergy between strong songwriting, potent subject matter, and eclectic musicianship that proves The Used continue to grow as people and as a band 15 years into their career. [28 Oct 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Pacific Daydream,60,"This is Weezer experimenting a little, while still remaining recognisably them. For those down for this sort of thing, stick on your dancing shoes and go with Pacific Daydream's flow. [21 Oct 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,The  Blood of Gods,60,"The results are much as you'd expect, with crazy lyrics and the occasional brilliant riff. [21 Oct 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Shapeshifter,80,"While Shapeshifter isn't a complete transformation, it is a confident and relatable expedition through adolescence. [14 Oct 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,As You Please,80,"[The] band's most atmospheric music to date. [14 Oct 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Heaven Upside Down,80,"Heaven Upside Down betters that record [2015's The Pale Emperor]. [14 Oct 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Nightbringers,80,"It's a beast from start to finish. [7 Oct 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Phantom Anthem,80,"A riveting convergence point for 14 years of expert graft. [7 Oct 2017, p.52]"
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),I Want to See Pulaski at Night [EP],67,These six instrumentals are pleasant if not pretty in the usual way an Andrew Bird instrumental track might be.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Hardcourage,74,Hardcourage is an exceedingly worthwhile release from a producer that's constantly pushing himself toward new things.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),California X,84,"It's one of the young year's best all-out rock records, the kind of fantastic full-length that some kid in a garage will one day look back to themselves, maybe when plugging that guitar in for the first time."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The  End of Silence,75,"The End of Silence is a serious statement that can bring the harshness of war to your ears and occasionally make you rethink how casually you consume the news. It's by no means an easy album to wander through, but I doubt it was ever Herbert's intention to make this 'easy listening' in any conventional sense of the term."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Julia with Blue Jeans On,78,"Such is Krug's way with words: deliberately or not, he's weaving a huge tapestry that makes the author clearer to us. Julia With Blue Jeans On is another section in it and is a damned beautiful, it not great one at that."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),R Plus Seven,90,"Here, Lopatin excels at what he's been doing since his first release as Oneohtrix Point Never, and what first brought us to him: drawing feeling out of the digital realm, instead of just channeling it."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Fuzz,78,Scoff at them for being a bit too obvious with their name but Fuzz and Fuzz deliver the garage rock roar we've come to expect from Segall and Co.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Jinx,77,"Granted, as they've smoothed out the rough edges a bit, some of the rugged immediacy has been lost, but they've more than make up for it in a newfound sense of lively rhythmic interaction."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Days Are Gone,85,"With the triumvirate of googly-eyed rhythms, sinfully catchy melodies and a breeziness that seems only fitting, they've served up one of the most auspicious debuts of the year."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Smilewound,53,"The timbre or the texture of the sounds they make is worth noting while working through Smilewound, but hardly worth returning specifically for."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The Bones of What You Believe,67,"They write very strong songs, but aural satiation sinks in over Bones' 48 minute runtime."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Brass,75,"Aside from a few inconsistencies, the change in sound is quite revitalizing and proves that there is more to Royal Bangs than a serious case of musical ADD."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Dream River,86,Dream River is as evocative a record as he's ever made and that's saying quite a lot.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Factory Floor,86,"Comparing it to where they once were, somewhere middling between post-rock and meandering industrial ambient, the sound of Factory Floor is of a band that is now confident in their own original and entirely dominant sound."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Repave,80,"The limits of Vernon's imagination and drive have yet to be truly tested, and based on the size of the sounds that he's summoning here, the ceiling isn't even in his sights yet."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),"Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action",52,"The experimental mindset is evident in moments of Right Thoughts, but only a select few, and like Tonight, it's most prominent on the last few tracks."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),AM,86,"AM is a pitch black party record, full of menacing pop and grimy, indelible grooves drowned in bourbon."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The Silver Gymnasium,81,"This album finds them going all-out in swashbuckling revelry for the most part, and it suits them better than anyone might have expected."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Versions,69,"With repeated listens though, the tracks on Versions don't entice you back again and again like the ominous hook-laden tracks of Stridulum or even the wide sound palette of Conatus do. Versions is probably best for those who were there at the Guggenheim concert."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Imps of Perversion,61,"Although working your way through the album can feel like trudging through the shit-stinking mud in the tunnels beneath the streets, there are glimpses of lights that break though from the surface, like manhole covers left exposed."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Loud City Song,88,"Loud City Song is a true achievement from Julia Holter. Nary is there a hook on the album, but the richness and vividness that she brings to the songs musically and lyrically will hook you more effectively anyway."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Doris,78,"Many of the best rap records are monochromatically single-minded, but then the other half, embrace contradictions as a weapon, rage hiding insecurities, heartless satire shielding weakness, such as Earl's hero, early period Slim Shady."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Howlin',72,"Mindlessly hummable and pure of vision, Howlin' sounds just as good coming from your headphones as it does from Marshall stacks."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Nepenthe,85,"Nepenthe isn't The Magic Place, but it certainly sounds like she's found another special site of inspiration. Thankfully for us it's just as prodigious and marvellous as anything else Barwick has put out before."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),MeYouWeYou,75,RocketNumberNine should be commended for the killer tracks that they've managed to pack into MeYouWeYou.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Bitchitronics,78,"On Bitchitronics, Bitchin Bajas make the journey from unconscious creation to physical expression in a way that few of their electronic peers would understand. Brian Eno and Robert Fripp would approve, I'd imagine."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Supermigration,69,"Even though Supermigration is constructed as a whole, it doesn't always work best in one sitting."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Music for Objects [EP],68,"At the very least instead of sounding like he was curling up into a melancholic hibernating state as on Exercises, here he sounds like he once again wants to fight the boredom and start actively engaging the listener on all levels."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Slow Focus,88,"Though it's hardly labyrinthine--these songs proceed in pretty much a linear fashion, Slow Focus immerses the listener in an aural landscape that offers so much to explore."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),White Mountain,75,"It just runs over half an hour, but time slips away when you're inside it, wandering about."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Beautiful Africa,83,"she recorded her fourth album with Polly Jean Harvey adjutant John Parish, and musically they get results.... But non-Bamanan speakers may well find that her supple vocals are no more engaging should they follow her unremarkable spiritual tribulations in English or French."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),An  Object,91,There's a pleasure on the far edge of song in imagining that two DIY purists are making all these musical noises with their guitar collection and their home studio.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),"The  Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You",91,"There are hooks here, folks, and literalism fan that I am, I say they're most effective on the strictly reportorial ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"" and the lost-love ""Calling Cards."""
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Run Fast,100,"The riot godmotherrr commands pretty much the same old skinny soprano, only with soft edges that sound tender or thoughtful sometimes."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),I Hate Music,91,"It's only natural that this is less of the same, and that in ""Void"" and ""Staying Home"" early on he's as bummed as a good grunge visionary should be."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The  Wack Album,83,"Struggling for cred as aging rappers will, they stumble occasionally. Some of these ideas obviously seemed funnier when they brainstormed them."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Magna Carta Holy Grail,83,"Give it up to the one where Beyonce pledges gangsta devotion and, best of all, the one where the ""billionaire"" (he says) looks back at the betrayals of his own departed head of family with something that feels like dread."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Pura Vida Conspiracy,100,"Re-examining his past, he imagines a future you can hum in your mind."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The  Year of No Returning,91,He sets his sacrilegious writ to muscular melodies that get more fetching as they speed up.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Mature Themes,91,Mature my patootie--and that's a good thing.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Come Cry with Me,83,"Displaced Canadian ""middle child"" cultivates honky-tonk misery so extreme it dallies with the absurd."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Child Ballads,83,"Yet subtle fiddle, accordion, pump organ, and especially bass liven up the acoustic guitars just a touch, and both Mitchell's fluting, childlike lead and Hamer's mellower follow avoid purist sanctity as well as modernizing pizzazz."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent [EP],83,"He wants to set his people on the right path and keeps thinking up explicit ways to say so. But none of them have gotten near that goal so far, not even theoretically, as they might if his skills included the ability to rise to actual hits, as opposed to pleasurable musicality, and also to sink to them."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Acid Rap,91,"Amusing though he and his yelp can be, I like him best when anxiety is a mood rather than a subject."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Born Sinner,83,"Like Illmatic it eschews pop emoluments, and conceptually it's just as canny."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Kenny Dennis LP,91,"The narrative matters on this album, and as always, newcomers should hear Dennehy first. But Cohn is one of a kind, and he don't stop."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Tape Two,91,"You'll soon feel how all those slight musical differentials hoist the group's collective spirit, and how courageously the music's depressive candor strengthens their will to be alive."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Wilderness,91,"These are so fine you don't mind listening again. And as you do, you start noticing how deftly Brett negotiates lines and stanzas that aren't as blockish as their meter and his voice make you think. And then you listen to this uningratiating music some more."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Monomania,100,"Consider me converted, at least until Bradford Cox lurches off in yet another direction."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Modern Vampires of the City,100,"Each verse/chorus/bridge/intro melody, each lyric straight or knotty, each sound effect playful or perverse (or both)Š—•-each is pleasurable in itself and aptly situated in the sturdy songs and tracks, so that the whole signifies without a hint of concept."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Hokey Fright,100,"The tunes are Dawson's because Ae-Rock doesn't do tunes, but his beats beef up those tunes just like his gruff, clotted flow beefs up her itty-bitty soprano."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Annie Up,91,A lark evolves into a business proposition as an album of 10 inspired three-minute songs eventuates in an album of 12 expert three-and-a-half-minŠ— ute songs.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Your Turn,91,"Six songs-with-lyrics, each with its own vocal signature although there's not a proper singer to be heard, and six instrumentals, some straight and some avant and one a loving yet crudely irreverent ""Take Five"" cover, converge toward the same goal: demolishing your musical illusions."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Chelsea Light Moving,83,"For better or worse, and it's both, this is kind of what you'd figure sort of: a Sonic Youth record dominated by that band's most important member."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Nanobots,83,"Overlooking the nine subminute snippetsŠ—•-most annoying even at that length, with bows to the nine-second ""Tick"" and the 24-second closerŠ—•-that leaves 16 songs that pretend to be songs, including one A plus, two clear A minuses, and six close enoughs."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Shaking the Habitual,100,"An exciting, multivalent Dreijer sibling showcase. Karin provides saving shades of humanity by exercising the vocal cords nature gave her. But Olof's imagination, sense of humor, and bent rebop carry the day."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Dad Country,91,"He's got relationship problems so depressing that he thinks calmly about killing himself. Yet even that doesn't stop him from saying what he has to say in under three minutes, with a catchy tune to help the time pass."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Wheelhouse,83,"A lot of the time he's trying too hard to say too little or trying too clumsily to say too much, sometimes even with his trusty guitar."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),I Am Not a Human Being II,91,"His posse cuts are finally showing some savor too, albeit not on the vestigial guns 'n' violence ones."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Rkives,100,"Near as I can hear, all that marks these terrific songs as outtakes etc. is that they're slightly less produced and dramatic."
The Boston Phoenix,Comedown Machine,75,"On Angles, the band tossed a few tunes out that sounded like carbon-copies of their first album, but on Machine they eschew that kind of market compromise in favor of following their strange muse, even if in the end most listeners will have trouble pegging down who it sounds like."
The Boston Phoenix,Strike Gently,50,The results are hit-or-miss.
The Boston Phoenix,The  Chronicles of Marnia,88,"These on-record musings never reveal the off-record Marnie, which is a shame, but the sprawling, chimerical Marnia brings you close enough to be captivating anyhow."
The Boston Phoenix,Welcome Oblivion,88,"Welcome Oblivion tracks like techno-folk haunter ""Ice Age"" and the doom-pop jaunt ""How Long?"" make uncredited cameo appearances in your nightmares until you go insane and eat your own hands."
The Boston Phoenix,Hit the Waves,63,Hit the Waves is so heartfelt as a pastiche of '80s alternative music that it almost muscles its way into being brilliant.
The Boston Phoenix,Honeys,88,"Four records deep, Pissed Jeans may have trimmed some heaviness, but they open space for discovery."
The Boston Phoenix,New Moon,88,New Moon is their most purposeful beast yet.
The Boston Phoenix,Torres,75,"It's easy to imagine her getting very famous, because Torres doesn't wash the songs out with its prettiness."
The Boston Phoenix,Amok,88,"AMOK is as heady and immersive as any great Radiohead album, but those comparisons eventually wilt: Yorke's new band has discovered a symmetry all its own."
The Boston Phoenix,The Messenger,63,"While lukewarm as a whole, The Messenger doesn't suck nearly enough to bruise Marr's status as a guitar deity on wheels."
The Boston Phoenix,When It Was Now,63,"It ain't exactly Bill Shakespeare (or Trojans), but it gets the job done."
The Boston Phoenix,Clash the Truth,88,"The beauty of Beach Fossils has always been in the tension between Payseur's disaffected deadpan and the band's super-visceral live shows (before Beach Fossils, he spent years playing in hardcore bands) and on Clash much of that post-punk energy translates seamlessly."
The Boston Phoenix,Push the Sky Away,63,"Push the Sky Away feels heavy on breath-taking and woodshedding, an album of waiting for sparks to ignite."
The Boston Phoenix,You're Nothing,75,"The lyrics resonate hard, though, felt most strongly when R’Ùnnenfelt sings with broad expressive shouts."
The Boston Phoenix,Tape One [EP],88,"Calculated yet impulsive, Young Fathers prove Scottish hip-hop's viability."
The Boston Phoenix,Pedestrian Verse,75,"The Scottish outfit have delivered again with jangly pop full of skittering guitars, self-flagellating lyricism, and whimsy under a pall of darkness that no amount of the big spotlight can dispel."
The Boston Phoenix,Holy Fire,75,Foals haven't lost their math-rock edge; they've infused it with fun.
The Boston Phoenix,II,63,Somebody needs to boot Nielson off his why-fi connection: beneath the murk is the work of a riveting craftsman.
The Boston Phoenix,Yeah Right,88,Bleeding Rainbow provide tunes to which one could satisfactorily gaze at his or her shoes during any point of the year.
The Boston Phoenix,Out of View,75,"The History of Apple Pie aren't exactly breaking new ground in the world of indie rock, but they are the sort of band who win you over in seconds."
The Boston Phoenix,The Flower Lane,75,"It's not as challenging as previous Ducktails recordings, but a pleasant pop record nonetheless, and the band's most universally accessible yet."
The Boston Phoenix,Beta Love,75,"Beta Love is the best of both worlds: surprisingly slick and danceable, while subtly amplifying their art-school charm."
The Boston Phoenix,Anything In Return,75,Anything in Return is his most melodic album.
The Boston Phoenix,Fade,88,"Tortoise's John McEntire steps in for long-time producer Roger Moutenot, but any of these songs would fit perfectly on the band's last half-dozen albums."
The Boston Phoenix,Long.Live.A$AP,63,"If there's a knock to be had against the Harlem rapper, it's that he lacks an original presence. So it's curious that for his major-label debut he's opted to further venture down the rabbit hole of references, loading Long.Live.A$AP with a bevy of guests with personalities far more distinctive than his own."
The Boston Phoenix,Love Sign,63,Love Sign dips a little too far into the Fountains of Wayne kiddie pool.
The Boston Phoenix,Lysandre,75,"Lysandre inevitably feels a bit skimpy. It's still an unnervingly tuneful warm-up: freed from his hipster shackles, Owens is harnessing the power of the incredibly uncool--and he's all the cooler for it."
The Boston Phoenix,Nocturne,50,"For the jaded among us, this is regressive and full of genre-contrivance."
The Boston Phoenix,Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors,75,"Fascinating speed-bumps aside, it's a mission still very much accomplished."
The Boston Phoenix,A Wretched Virile Lore,50,"And so it goes with Mogwai's A Wrenched Virile Lore: a broad range of electro producers, ambient knob-twiddlers, and singer-songwriters re-assemble the Scottish post-rock champs' most recent studio album, the excellent Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will, mostly with shitty bonus-feature-styled results."
CMJ,Viet Cong,80,"For now, it is refreshing to hear a band mining the searing sounds of '81 as a cold breeze that kind of shakes you awake rather than making you want to run back indoors right away to cower under your own fears."
CMJ,Club Meds,80,"The sedation blurs the transition of space and time, and Mangan skillfully plays with the passing of each to create unexpected pacing that adds to the overall feel, giving the album moments that range from subdued melancholy to impassioned rock."
CMJ,Girlpool [EP],80,"All in all, Girlpool is the kind of EP made for those moments when you feel big on the outside, but aren't so sure on the inside."
CMJ,I'm in Your Mind Fuzz,70,"The songs are solid and don't mess around as much as the show. Though the non-stop, not exactly dancey indulgence groove ride of the whole first half, no pause until six songs in, might nag some."
CMJ,Soft,70,"Soft hits on some deeply buried emotions ('I left scraps inside of you' on Soft Opening; 'If you feel a rusted heart/don't let them know' on Rusty), but does it with such grace that it's easy to convince yourself this is an album of all-forgiving love."
CMJ,Seeds,70,"The album churns away on a mid-tempo path throughout, ethereal harmonies skimming past and back to Adebimpe's yearning lead vocals being the main thread through it."
CMJ,Pom Pom,70,"As convoluted as it may seem at first, there is merit to the deranged genius of Ariel Pink."
CMJ,Content Nausea,70,"Brittle, spare yet maximalist in sound, Content Nausea is mostly successful, with a few key missteps."
CMJ,DSU,80,"Throughout DSU, Alex G fills in gaps and layers over his songs' simple backbones with shy yet enthralling tweaks and shuffles."
CMJ,Xen,80,"The album's 15 tracks don't quite reach the 40-minute mark, but each track has a unique identity that both stands alone yet slips into the narrative of Xen."
CMJ,Alone For the First Time,80,"Though Hemsworth's style tends to favor chirping cheeriness, Alone For The First Time is solidly a winter album, and it's just what we needed right now."
CMJ,La Isla Bonita,80,"Refuse be fooled by the any cutesy pop leanings. La Isla Bonita is wonderful, but there are no all-inclusive resorts on this island."
CMJ,'77,70,"There's a good amount of experimentation here, and very few misfires."
CMJ,Black Metal,80,"Black Metal is Blunt's most realized work yet, but it's still shrouded in mystery. There's no reason for that to change, and there's not even a hint here that Blunt is anywhere near ready to fold."
CMJ,Songs,80,"Songs will reward repeated listens, and firmly establishes Deptford Goth as a talent to keep an eye on."
CMJ,Rip This,70,"Now that Barrett's had a solid touring duo together for awhile, and they've got a couple albums under their studded leather belt, the duo (Len Clark on skins) has that feeling of an act at its third album phase: assured, strong, but teetering on a decision to leave its comfort zone or not."
CMJ,No One Wants To Be Here and No One Wants To Leave,80,Nobody Wants To Be Here And Nobody Wants To Leave will do more than satisfy existing fans of the band; new fans too would do well to start here.
CMJ,Meatbodies,80,"The band's adept at sustaining a singular sound throughout via rabid drumming, guitar fuzz at burning moss level and the fractured harmonies at freaky."
CMJ,Bazaar,70,"There aren't any bad songs here, but ultimately Bazaar comes off more like a compilation album of great tracks than a carefully edited album."
CMJ,Taiga,70,"Taiga marks Danilova's own internal struggle to continue to carve out her own musical path. And so far, so good."
CMJ,We Come from the Same Place,80,"We Come From The Same Place is an album that often opts for the direct over the obscure, but taken as a whole it evokes something difficult to articulate about life and love. Both musically and lyrically, this album serves as definitive proof that this band is on a roll."
CMJ,A New Testament,80,"A New Testament is a charming, compelling and overwhelmingly genuine piece of work from an artist who seems determined to confound expectations."
CMJ,Feel Something,80,Feel Something is never anything less than enthralling in its mushy melodies and gossamer vocals that'll have many crushing on this record through the cold months.
CMJ,Black Moon Spell,70,"If you can glaze over the four total minutes that those three aforementioned songs [""I Love You Ugly,"" ""Madness,"" and ""Demon From Hell""] occupy, what's left is an all-around good time."
CMJ,Sukierae,80,"As a whole, the album is charming, but deeply moving. The instrumentation is often simple, as are the lyrics, and the result is a rewarding, slow-building work of serious depth, and a long overdue solo debut for one of the genre's finest songwriters."
CMJ,Ontario Gothic,80,"Ontario Gothic is an amazingly precise, contextually aware work that's very easy to listen to as just beautiful music, but it's also an album that asks the listener to try for more."
CMJ,Weirdon,80,"Weirdon is stacked with some hefty singles guaranteed to bring this band to an even wider audience, and it succeeds because it ups the ante in terms of songcraft and production, but never at the cost of the weirdness."
CMJ,Too Bright,90,"Too Bright is a near immaculate work. It's bold but vulnerable and finds Hadreas taking risks in structure, content and sound."
CMJ,The Physical World,70,"Although the album loses some steam in its second side, it is light-years away from disappointing. Instead, it is proof that this band has aged well."
CMJ,At Best Cuckold,70,"But because of its uneven idiosyncrasies and its cheeky self-flagellation, At Best Cuckhold sounds like Avi Buffalo's coming of age story."
Paste Magazine,In a Poem Unlimited,78,"Throughout, there's a dynamic contrast of ultra-femininity with talk of violence, power, and crouching wrath."
Paste Magazine,Make Way for Love,77,"His velvet-rich voice is one that's part lounge smoothie, one part vintage crooner, and one part vampiric Roy Orbison filled to the brim with drama and inherent romance. This ensures that Make Way For Love is more than an album full of weepy torch-songs, but an ode to all the feelings and phases that are the makings of a relationship's end."
Paste Magazine,Sleepwalkers,73,"Fallon has a knack for crafting sturdy tunes that border on anthemic, and every chorus has fist-pumping potential. He has a full-throated approach to vocals, singing nearly every song, even the slow jams, in a raw, aching voice that conveys a sense of urgency."
Paste Magazine,Little Dark Age,80,It slowly and steadily comes into focus over the course of its running time.
Paste Magazine,Walk Between Worlds,78,"This sense of fearlessness permeates this album. Simple Minds positions themselves perfectly on Worlds: not trying to relive past victories nor trying to match up with the sound of current chart hits. Kerr, his longtime bandmate Charlie Burchill and the current lineup of the group remain true to themselves, with a wonderful collection of dramatic, thoughtful songs that contains messages that can serve both personal and universal concerns."
Paste Magazine,All Melody,86,"Frahm's first major solo work since Spaces, and it finds its maker exploring new sounds and new spaces with often stunning results."
Paste Magazine,Lionheart,82,"Lionheart sounds amazing, with tasteful production and nary a note out of place. It'd probably benefit from a rough edge here or there, even. But in terms of songcraft, performance and message, it's an impressive step into the solo spotlight by McEntire."
Paste Magazine,Marble Skies,78,"Marble Skies is at its best, however, where Django Django pushes outward hardest and farthest--in two very different directions. On one end there's 'Sundials,' a beautiful ballad built atop a zig-zagging piano line that lifts the technical wizard's hat off this band, offering a clear look at the human beings beneath. (The song's jazzy, harmony-heavy coda is a delight, too.) On the other end is 'Surface to Air,' a concoction of humid pop, hiccupping beats and guest vocals by Rebecca Taylor of the British band Slow Club."
Paste Magazine,Laughing At The System [EP],74,"Any new Total Control music is worth having in the world, even if, as Laughing does, it feels like the group is holding back somewhat."
Paste Magazine,Freedom's Goblin,94,"Ty Segall has made a massive album that not only celebrates that freedom he's carved out for himself, it also effectively summarizes the journey so far. And it's pretty darn listenable to boot. It may very well be his greatest accomplishment yet."
Paste Magazine,Snares Like a Haircut,88,"It's what you should put on when you don't want to think; aggressive, enveloping, and with just enough of a bite to corroborate your deeply held belief that you're not one of them."
Paste Magazine,Shadow People,67,"There are truly transcendent moments on Shadow People, they're just nestled in among the ones that never quite lift off. Add it all up and The Limi’±anas remain a very cool band, which is a perfectly fine thing to be."
Paste Magazine,Semicircle,77,"Since they've never really been able to top 2004's Thunder, Lightning, Strike, that means that everything on Semicircle is fun, but not much of it is super fun. It's kind of like going a field trip; technically you're not at school, but it's still school."
Paste Magazine,I Like Fun,89,I Like Fun rocks unabashedly.
Paste Magazine,Ruins,91,It's the last three songs that push an already arresting album to the next level.
Paste Magazine,This Is Glue,83,"It's certainly a departure from the shaggy surf-rock of their debut, Metalmania, but one that feels natural and deftly executed."
Paste Magazine,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,70,Suffice it to say that Private Life is as socially conscious as albums come. It can also be a slog to get through.
Paste Magazine,The  Official Body,89,"Instead of offering up another vaguely-feminist cash-grab or a haphazard political patch job, Shopping continue to do what they do best, using their bass lines and unique perspective to provide a source of kinship, understanding and an outlet to vent general frustration."
Paste Magazine,The House,74,"The House feels like a transitional work, one saddled with stylistic experiments and themes of rebirth, renewal, self-discovery and so on. Perhaps that bodes well for Porches Album #4, whenever it arrives. And perhaps it will tie up some of The House's loose ends."
Paste Magazine,Encore,78,There's still more than enough fuel in Encore's tank to heartily recommend it. I'm just waiting for him to dare a leap into the unknown.
Paste Magazine,Wrong Creatures,64,"Fans of BRMC, fans of bluesy psych rock and fans of anyone that's still out there trying to do it with a guitar will love Wrong Creatures. For fans of rock music that jolts you awake and holds you by the throat, It's just not gonna rock you like it used to."
Paste Magazine,Songs of Praise,84,"Delivered with a heavy dose of grit and honesty, there's some teeth marks there, but not the whole bite. It makes for their own, unique brand of sociopolitics-lite, done with a nudge, a wink, and just enough of the unexpected."
Paste Magazine,POST-,82,"According to Rosenstock, it was recorded with friends in secret, and finished just before it was released. You can hear all of that in these songs, which crackle with urgency and fun. POST- feels less like an album and more like a document of tightly knit people working hard to make something that feels cathartic and good."
Paste Magazine,"Lost at Last, Vol. 1",91,"It's all supported by a through-line of warm, cozy production that imbues the album with a pleasant nostalgia, the kind we've come to expect from Slim and his reworking of dug-in American genres like folk, country, and blues."
Paste Magazine,War & Leisure,87,"After 11 tracks of carefree sex jams, it's good to hear the guy stretching himself into a different direction. That's something Miguel has always done, sonically speaking. And he always sounds amazing doing it; that hasn't changed on War & Leisure."
Paste Magazine,What Makes You Country,70,What Makes You Country has no shortage of potential hits.
Paste Magazine,Revival,68,"Overall, the album is fairly easy listening."
Paste Magazine,"How to Solve Our Human Problems, Pt. 1 [EP]",79,"The tracks on these EPs were not gathered from the cutting-room floor; they were every bit as strong as those found on the aforementioned albums [Tigermilk, If You're Feeling Sinister and The Boy With the Arab Strap]."
Paste Magazine,Singles 1978-2016 [Box Set],78,"The three-disc version is a great foundational understanding of what The Fall and Mark E. Smith is all about, but the hefty seven-disc issue offers up the blueprints for the whole operation. Whether your interest is just in seeing why groups like Pavement and Elastica marked this band as a major influence or if it's in jumping into the Olympic-sized pool of material by The Fall, you know which lane to choose."
Paste Magazine,Who Built the Moon?,84,This is Noel's strongest work post-Oasis...maybe even Liam.
The Quietus,Landfall,80,"You might not have thought to put Anderson and Kronos Quartet together, but they did think of it, and the results are, in both the philosophical and the colloquial senses, sublime."
The Quietus,Transangelic Exodus,80,"It turns out that Transangelic Exodus is a fitting title, then, for an artist emerging from his early career and crafting a new project that's satisfying and unique."
The Quietus,The Hands,80,"Brutal yet cathartic. ... Consisting of seven relatively short pieces across 36 minutes, The Hands plays like a succession of scenes or vignettes all attempting to communicate some opaque and unsayable knowledge."
The Quietus,Always Ascending,70,"It is by no means perfect, and at points misjudged, but for the first time since the early 2000s we have a record that runs the gamut of what makes Franz Ferdinand great: it is an album full of character, craft and flair all at once."
The Quietus,"Vision Songs, Vol. 1 [Reissue]",70,"An album of sedative songs fading between each other, it feels more like a notebook than an album with a defining concept. It is easier to tackle Vision Songs Vol. 1 as if it were a continual chant."
The Quietus,I,80,"This album is an excellent opening entry into what will hopefully be a new series of releases from Kaukolampi, one which rewards returning visits to the places beyond the restrictions of both gravity and mundanity."
The Quietus,Mother,60,"Mother finds the band tremendous on all fronts, but the rabid, manic excitement of 'Only Love' overshadows everything else. There are no other moments on the record like it, nothing as intensely unhinged or exciting.  However lovely and affecting the rest of the record is, as it drifts further and further into more serene climes, the spectre of this extraordinary early blast grows in the back of your mind, and you're willing them to let go of their beautiful refinement just one more time."
The Quietus,Open Here,80,"In the years to come we might turn to Plumb or Measure before Open Here to remind ourselves of the essential Field Music, yet this, their seventh record, is nevertheless a thing of immense songwriting charm and ideological strength, defined by its sardonic judgement of various seismic social shifts."
The Quietus,Love Jail,70,"Love Jail is no masterpiece, but Wilson and his bandmates' instincts are most often good. There are far worse roadtrip companions."
The Quietus,Laughing At The System [EP],80,"Total Control have crafted a sonic scroll that is freer, weirder, and tighter than anything they have put together before."
The Quietus,Change,80,"On Change, Cindy Wilson finally shares her formidable pop intelligence, unmediated."
The Quietus,The House,80,"On The House, Maine is vulnerable, honest and strong--he soars on this, his best album yet."
The Quietus,Songs of Praise,80,"Songs Of Praise is an ambitious, ferocious debut from a band who might just have something new to say about being a (load of white men in a) guitar band."
The Quietus,Hesaitix,80,"In this transition from experimental noise that revels in randomness and discomfort, the album layers sound into intense, hypnotic rhythms that reveal compositional prowess."
The Quietus,Tommy [EP],80,"Her latest creative effort, Tommy on Hyperdub Records, is the darker, more mature, older sibling to Lagata, and another firm exposition of her unique and extensive vocal ability and her creative, DIY production style."
The Quietus,It's Alright Between Us as It Is,70,"It's Alright Between Us As It Is is an album of variation. 'But Isn't It' and 'Shinin' are weak, but this is a miscalculation in production and uninspired lyric writing, as opposed to anything which puts any lasting worry in our mind about Lindstr’Ùm's abilities. The work is not his most creative, he's not redrawing any of the lines of genre which he himself first traced with previous works."
The Quietus,The Saga Continues,50,"The Saga Continues is lacklustre. At times it ventures into sellout territory. It's not a terrible album (maybe I'll add a few tracks to my 'Chill' playlist) but it never breaks new ground and it never touches the magic of 36 Chambers. Instead, it settles in a slightly anaemic midpoint between nostalgia and commercial compromise."
The Quietus,Romaplasm,80,"On Romaplasm, Wiesenfeld seems to have finally made something that could pass as a pop record, exuberant in both its content and execution."
The Quietus,The Centre Cannot Hold,80,"There are moments where Frost is clearly the architect and noise tamer, orchestrating becalmed undulations that offer repose, often of lament rather than of hope. ... Yet there are just as many moments when Frost lets his muse fuse with unadorned, unadulterated noise, creating arpeggios of tension that ratchet up steadily, the life raft tipping over, all feeling of equilibrium and control ripping away from the listener and composer both."
The Quietus,Saturation III,70,"Saturation III is for the fans: their most abstract, their most experimental, and by far their weirdest."
The Quietus,Polygondwanaland,80,"Polygondwanaland is one of their strongest excursions yet, not just of this year but of any."
The Quietus,No Luscious Life,80,"The songs are actually seven suites (on what is their seventh release) of kaleidoscopic, expansionist flailing and freedo(o)m, the only throughline being that they remain inherently odd and pleasurable."
The Quietus,Gallarais,80,"Gallarais is a quiet album, but a deeply unsettling one."
The Quietus,Introduction to Escape-Ism,80,"This is Svenonius with just an electric guitar, a microphone, an analogue-sounding drum machine and a tape deck, creating the rawest and most stripped-back manifestation of his singular muse to date."
The Quietus,The Book of Law,60,"While the album itself falls short. The ambition is admirable, but what makes the songs commendable is their refusal to thrive. They are deeply melancholic. There's a focus on Rothman's drug addiction itself rather than the desire to resolve it, a resignation to dying rather than a desire to learn how to live."
The Quietus,A Pocket of Wind Resistance,80,"A Pocket Of Wind Resistance combines powerful storytelling and songwriting to produce something special. Polwart and Murphy make Fala Flow seem unnervingly real, conjuring atmosphere through quiet incantation and simple but resonant instrumentation. They also deliver a strong political message in the best traditions of folk music, making health equality something to sing about."
The Quietus,Utopia,80,"Utopia is not just an album about intimacy, it also expresses a degree of intimacy that goes beyond words--especially in the sense that her voice sounds so detailed here, and in the ways she works with Arca."
The Quietus,Arpo,80,"This is Svenonius with just an electric guitar, a microphone, an analogue-sounding drum machine and a tape deck, creating the rawest and most stripped-back manifestation of his singular muse to date."
The Quietus,Reaching for Indigo,80,"The tropes of romantic art are self-consciously manipulated, but the artifice is made plain, and the finished work feels more real as a result."
The Quietus,Bajas Fresh,80,"At their most free-floating and understated, Bitchin Bajas almost casually demonstrate how apparent serenity still provides room for subtle explorations, additions to the predominant flow heightening the overall mood."
DJ Booth,Compton,90,"It's ambitious, it's diverse, it's exciting and when you hear you hear what made Dre a legend in the first place. No matter what the era, stream, CD or vinyl, Dr. Dre is just on another level."
DJ Booth,FWA (Free Weezy Album),60,Nothing on par with the classics but he has plenty of moments where his strengths are showcased.
DJ Booth,Dreams Worth More Than Money,80,"Meek understands his audience, they expect a monumental introduction, summer ready hits, sincerity and more hits. He does this all, with a bit of style and an abundance of swagger."
DJ Booth,Summertime '06,80,"Vince sounds more alive on this album, that coldhearted monotone has found a bit of hope."
DJ Booth,Love Story,80,"It may have been a little long for my liking, but that's a small price to pay for listening to something this remarkably unique."
DJ Booth,Barter 6,60,"The rapping isn't the problem, it's his singing and eccentric sounds that leaves me with Van Gogh thoughts."
DJ Booth,Touch Down 2 Cause Hell,80,A listen will be worth your time.
DJ Booth,I Don't Like Shit: I Don't Go Outside,80,"Not only does it reinforce that Earl is a capable lyricist, but that he's growing his legs as a producer. It's also an album where you can tell the artist found his voice, finally overcoming the pressures of expectation."
DJ Booth,Dark Sky Paradise,80,"Ultimately, only time will tell if Dark Sky Paradise becomes the first Big Sean album that I like more than his mixtapes, but this one probably has the best chance yet."
DJ Booth,If You're Reading This It's Too Late [Mixtape],70,"The ""album"" feels like a bunch of random songs, some quality songs mind you, but still just a bunch of songs that don't add up to anything larger."
DJ Booth,B4.DA.$$,70,"This is a good album by all accounts, but it's just not enough to free Joey from rap purgatory."
DJ Booth,My Garden,80,Kat Dahlia's My Garden is good music. Period.
DJ Booth,Black Messiah,90,"The music on Black Messiah is quietly powerful, which is the most powerful form of power."
DJ Booth,The Pinkprint,70,"There's frankly very little chance I'd ever listen to this album again if I wasn't obligated to revisit it in a month via ""1 Listen"" rules, but Nicki's got her own lane and it's not a lane I'm going to roadblock."
DJ Booth,2014 Forest Hills Drive,80,Forest Hills Drive has enough twists and turns to inspire an almost schizophrenic stream of reactions.
DJ Booth,Hood Billionaire,60,"There is very little to write home about here, and for the most part it feels very hastily made."
DJ Booth,Cadillactica,90,"This isn't a great rap album, it's just a great album. Period."
DJ Booth,Under Pressure,90,"This has the feel of a full, complete body of work, one embedded with nuances, themes and a larger, interwoven framework that nobody could digest in one listen."
DJ Booth,RTJ2,90,"From ""Jeopardy"" on, Run the Jewels 2 is uppercut after uppercut."
DJ Booth,Paperwork,80,Paperwork is at its most compelling when it feels like he's being the most autobiographical.
DJ Booth,PartyNextDoor Two,60,"Absolutely none of the album is bad, but it's enough like Drake to make me feel like I might as well be listening to Drake, enough like The Weeknd to make me feel like I might as well be listening to Weeknd, etc. etc. etc."
DJ Booth,X,80,"There aren't many singers who have both the vocal ability and range of delivery to traverse a musical landscape that vast, but Brown does it all while impressively managing to maintain a real cohesion throughout X."
DJ Booth,Seen It All: The Autobiography,80,"On the whole though, while it might not be a classic, Seen It All will go down in hip-hop history as yet another dope album from an artist who's had an enormous (although under-rated) impact on rap."
DJ Booth,Blacc Hollywood,70,"It feels like Wiz is mostly coasting through this album, giving his already loyal fans exactly what they'd expect from him and not much else."
DJ Booth,These Days...,80,"These days, Soul's money tree has blossomed and with it, expectations have grown and relationships and trust are harder to come by. But for now at least, Soul is in control."
DJ Booth,Nobody's Smiling,80,"For the most part, Common's been an almost staggeringly consistent presence in music for years, and then fittingly, his new album Nobody's Smiling, is as good as anything he's done."
DJ Booth,Paula,40,"It's an odd, disjointed album that, despite scattered high points, leaves one wondering what Thicke was thinking when he put it together. Paula Patton deserves better, and so do listeners."
DJ Booth,Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire to Win,70,"The animal spin on Get Rich or Die Tryin'. 50 Cent attacks with that mindset on his 5th album, and it's a solid entry in a very up and down career (in music at least)."
DJ Booth,RetroHash,80,"The album is fun, enjoyable, and well-done."
DJ Booth,Z [EP],80,"Z is a mood piece, 10 homogenous tracks that breeze by and flow on a winning combination of sweet vocals, sweeter hooks, and the sweetest of melodies and instrumentals."
Logo,Lay Of The Land,90,"They're the most unique band since The Van Pelt or At The Drive-In, with vocals comparable to the lyrical finesse of Tim Booth."
Logo,Neighborhood Watch,70,"Their third album finds them immersed in light-hearted, yet imaginative hop 'n' soul, Parliamentarian funk and the fiery chants of lead single 'This Way'."
Logo,On My Way,80,"It's Kweller's lyrics and voice that do it though; joy and melancholy combined to deliver pop as uplifting as Weezer and rock that's as unsubtle as Kings of Leon, with anti-folk and Merseybeat along for what is a thrill-filled ride."
Logo,Good News For People Who Love Bad News,90,"Never happily slotting into any template demanded back in their home town, MM are nearer to some wondrous mish-mash of Pavement and Beck; closer in harmony to The Flaming Lips."
Logo,Trading Snake Oil For Wolftickets,60,"Jules' talents lie closer to the downhome folksiness of Cat Stevens, enlivened by an eye for detail previously thought the sole preserve of Elliott Smith."
Logo,The Volunteers,80,"Striped of its proto-emo veneer this is sterling stuff, which - although fraught with angst - is run through with a mellow, humbling tone that is as infectious and accessible as it is true to hardcore's staunch code of ethical values."
Logo,Misery Is A Butterfly,80,"Like an air-bushed Slint re-emerging with Stereolab as their chief influence, Blonde Redhead engulf their guitars beneath so many keyboard tinkerings."
Logo,Animal Serenade,70,"It's worth ploughing through the strange to get to the beautiful, disturbing, fucked-up 'Venus In Furs' though, worth the full five stars all by itself."
Logo,Till Death Do Us Part,80,"For the first time in nearly a decade Cypress Hill sound like they're really enjoying themselves, just like they were in the beginning."
Logo,Our Endless Numbered Days,80,Reveals Sam Beam to be a songwriter of exquisite talent and enviable inspiration.
Logo,Venice,90,[His] most spellbinding LP to date.
Logo,Grown Backwards,80,Young pretenders beware: this old dog isn't so much learning new tricks as inventing them.
Logo,Battery,40,"The melancholy on offer barely gets above the level of sixth form poetry, and though Wilson tries to sound impassioned he comes across as strained."
Logo,Milk Man,90,"So horribly untrendy it's a new-black must-have, 'Milk Man' is the essential oddity of 2004, and a more-than-worthy successor to 2003's magnificent 'Apple O''."
Logo,Ultravisitor,80,"This is like saddling up with a fearless, interdimensional astronaut; fasten your seat belts."
Logo,Fall Back Open,80,"Their country-sagged beat-focused rock remains, which, coupled with some sumptuous keys and Andy LeMaster's notoriously unnerving range, reveal Now It's Overhead's startling magnetism."
Logo,Pawn Shoppe Heart,80,This is a rock 'n' roll album in the same way that 'Fun House' was a rock 'n' roll album.
Logo,Franz Ferdinand,80,"No affectation, no pandering to fashion, just good old fashioned rock 'n' roll. How refreshing."
Logo,When It Falls,70,"'When It Falls' is not an immediate album, it's a slow burner and one day, after countless hours playing it in the background, you'll hear something that makes you turn it up; that's the moment that it hooks you."
Logo,"They Were Wrong, So We Drowned",80,"There's nothing even remotely punk-funk here, instead conventional structures are stretched, shattered and re-assembled."
Logo,Virginia Creeper,70,"His carefully constructed tales are accompanied by a warm intimacy, the folky-edge only reinforcing the emphasis on the stories."
Logo,Shadows Collide With People,80,"At eighteen tracks it comes close to outstaying its welcome, but it doesn't."
Logo,Liberation,70,"'Liberation' is the most damning indictment of the Bush administration yet recorded, and it's all subliminal. Magnificent."
Logo,Kila Kila Kila,70,"A collection of chaotic - yet charming - avant-pop rooted in Japanese culture both martial and precise, like letting blood in a rock garden."
Logo,Monsoon,80,There's something here that most - if not all - will find thoroughly refreshing and enchanting.
Logo,Aw C'Mon,80,"This is deep, rich, slightly unnerving and very very beautiful music. [combined review of both discs]"
Logo,"No, You C'Mon",80,"No You C'Mon' is more schizophrenic but equally satisfying, ranging from dinner jazz to bursts of discordant piano boogie."
Logo,Marshall's House,40,"The trouble is, fine guitarist though he is, he too rarely demonstrates his skills, content to cruise on a simple melody."
Logo,Perpetuum Mobile,80,"This is uncommonly powerful music, created from common instruments."
Logo,America's Sweetheart,30,Derivative and unfocused from every conceivable angle.
The A.V. Club,Songs of Experience,33,"Songs Of Experience, U2's 14th studio album, revs up the ambition, to embarrassing results. It finds the group desperately searching for a radio hit while pontificating on American exceptionalism, shoehorning the Syrian refugee crisis into not one but two love songs--and on consecutive tracks, no less."
The A.V. Club,Who Built the Moon?,58,"It's like an extremely amped-up version of Oasis, but the excesses sway from impressive to taxing. Often the effort to be interesting just comes off as nonsensical cacophony."
The A.V. Club,The Greatest Gift,83,"'Wallowa' is a harrowing, metaphor-packed epic about her battle with depression and eventual death. And honestly, everything else here is kind of icing after that one."
The A.V. Club,Utopia,100,"It is musically heady and rawly autobiographical, translating the most intimate moments into towering, skywritten love notes. It's ruled by a divine feminine energy that interrogates toxic masculinity and, more subliminally, environmental issues. ... In other words, it's a journey that's easy to want to take with her."
The A.V. Club,Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light,83,"Light is two harsh, ugly sounds that sound harsh and ugly together, but the hint of a pop sensibility throbs underneath: a heartbeat faintly audible over the screams of hell."
The A.V. Club,Rest,83,"The influence of Gainsbourg's famous musical parents, both Serge and mother Jane Birkin, has been a constant in her music, but on Rest, she seems less daunted by her lineage, and she begins to bend it to her own ambitions."
The A.V. Club,Soul of a Woman,75,"After the James Brown frenzy of its opening tracks and the less memorable Motown-inspired middle ground, the album changes course. This reprise of Jones' established work ends and listeners get a peek at what would have come next: an odyssey of densely symphonic funk and soul."
The A.V. Club,Memory of a Cut Off Head,75,"Although Memory Of A Cut Off Head might benefit from some more garage-rock grit and aggression here and there, its manicured tranquility leaves a lasting impression."
The A.V. Club,If All I Was Was Black,75,"If All I Was Was Black is suffused with contemporary political resonance, married to Staples' timelessly transcendent gospel-meets-bluesy-folk. That push-pull between sorrowful analysis of the current state of the country and hope for the future is its defining quality, and it works--mostly."
The A.V. Club,Low in High School,75,"Instead of your lonely, romantic proxy, he's your surly, sometimes cool uncle who's set in his ways but still capable of surprises. Low In High School has a few of those, most effectively on the mid-album epic 'I Bury The Living.'"
The A.V. Club,reputation,75,"The sparkling, writerly synth-pop of 1989 has been jettisoned almost entirely, replaced by thudding trap beats, Vegas EDM, melancholy Drive-wave synthesizers, and splashes of Miami bass. More often than not, it works."
The A.V. Club,Stranger,67,"His flow is less ostentatiously stilted than on earlier efforts, as if, now that this territory is being explored successfully by others, he no longer needs to exaggerate his outsider status. He floats into the vapor, drugged out and miserable, like the album itself."
The A.V. Club,Interiors,67,"A mostly mid-tempo record with a few solid standouts, including album-opener 'Illuminant' and the vibey, spacey 'Cosmonauts.' It's still the third-best Quicksand album, but the distance between it and second place isn't nearly as far as it might've been."
The A.V. Club,Phases,91,"With its plaintive lyrics, Phases further shows that Olsen, like those venerable musicians, is a persistent truth teller, an authentic voice no matter what style she's working in."
The A.V. Club,The Dusk in Us,83,"The Dusk In Us can't match the apocalyptic power of a classic like 2001's Jane Doe, but when Converge takes a victory lap, it still does it at a mad sprint."
The A.V. Club,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,75,"The tough, chest-beating first disc gives way to a second disc that's just a little too fond of syrupy interludes. But as with his other releases, K.R.I.T.'s signature sincerity reigns supreme."
The A.V. Club,The  Thrill of It All,50,"To date, the only real distinction of Smith's music is his voice--and though he's a talented singer, even that's dulled by songs this predictably vanilla."
The A.V. Club,Revelations,75,"Revelations thrives in that dissonance between its lo-fi production and Shamir's striking falsetto, with tracks like 'Her Story' impressively melding Motown and grunge influences."
The A.V. Club,Plunge,91,"Beyond its aggressive peaks, there is also true beauty here, and even nuggets of stark synth-pop that call back to her past work."
The A.V. Club,Beach House III,75,"While 2015's Free TC felt designed to impress, a little too encyclopedic and earnest for its own good, Beach House 3 takes its concept literally, soundtracking a hypothetical bender in a paradise where the comedown never arrives."
The A.V. Club,Screen Memories,67,"Chances are you'll once again walk away with some of its lyrics rattling around your brain. On the other hand, those lyrics have never seemed more like open dares to take them way, way too seriously."
The A.V. Club,Turn Out the Lights,100,"Turn Out The Lights is beautifully crafted throughout, full of the kinds of songs that linger long after they've ended. Baker doesn't make it easy, but fans wouldn't have it any other way."
The A.V. Club,Pacific Daydream,42,"The Weezer frontman continues to tap that increasingly dry well, his dusty lovelorn longings for perfect summer nights now sounding completely formulaic."
The A.V. Club,III,75,"There are moments on III where the band stumbles--'Witness' ebbs just a hair too close to The Rolling Stones' 'Paint It Black'--but by and large, Makthaverskan has never been sharper than it is in the present moment."
The A.V. Club,Mirror Reaper,91,"Attention spans will certainly be tested, but surrender to the despair and Bell Witch's slow-motion eulogy--delivered through a lonely ring of guitar, gently crashing cymbals, and stray funeral-home organ--hits like a blast beat to the heart."
The A.V. Club,It's Alright Between Us as It Is,83,It's Alright Between Us As It Is feeds the body and soul.
The A.V. Club,All American Made,83,It's the title track--a soft and heart-wrenching protest song that captures the struggle of living in the U.S.--that cements Price's songwriting bona fides as a fiercely important voice in modern country.
The A.V. Club,Losing,75,"Even at that short running time, Losing's 12 songs start to blur together toward the end, but the album's many charms keep that from becoming a liability."
The A.V. Club,Ken,75,"This record is a grower whose off-putting quirks--like the swampy electronic muck that surrounds Bejar on 'Saw You At The Hospital' or the discordant droning foundation of 'A Light Travels Down The Catwalk'--give way and blend with all the gloss underneath them into yet another strange, frequently gorgeous album."
The A.V. Club,Glasshouse,83,"While all of this could feel a bit scattershot in lesser hands, there's a writerly clarity to her compositions that ties them all together into a cohesive statement of marital and maternal devotion."
Exclaim,All Melody,80,"It's an impressive compilation of provocatively disparate ideas, but taken in in its intended order, there's a mesmerizing continuity to it all."
Exclaim,Marble Skies,80,"It's a mature and refined album woven deeply enough into pop's historical fabric to please connoisseurs, but with enough lightness and fun for casual appeal as well."
Exclaim,The Age of Absurdity,40,"The Age of Absurdity is tacky, unoriginal, occasionally annoying and altogether not good. Most of the blame falls squarely on vocalist Neil Starr, whose lyrics stumble through sleaze rock clich’©s that were already dated in 1988."
Exclaim,The Thread That Keeps Us,40,"There are some truly enjoyable moments on Calexico's latest--but they're vastly overshadowed by at turns annoying or just boring tracks, bogged down in an overly long record."
Exclaim,Mother,90,"Mother finds Xylouris White quietly questioning musical structure and expectations. They remain trailblazing outliers with a supernatural power to express themselves as one and, with a warmth and welcoming generosity of spirit, invite listeners to step up and out of their comfort zones."
Exclaim,A Day With The Homies [EP],80,The lyrics are murky--there are none of the plainspoken tales of domesticity that Lennox used to specialize in--but the burbling soundscapes and soaring pop melodies are gorgeous.
Exclaim,Earthtones,80,"This is the work of ravenous, restless musicians who refuse to be pigeonholed."
Exclaim,Snares Like a Haircut,70,"Snares Like a Haircut might be their most accessible and uplifting record yet; released in a time of social decay, it's a statement that rings loud and clear."
Exclaim,Mania,50,Too often the band fall prey to the conventions of the music from which they're borrowing.
Exclaim,Medicine Songs,80,"Unlike her Polaris Prize-winning 2015 record Power in the Blood, there are no love songs; Medicine Songs is unflinching in its focus."
Exclaim,I Like Fun,70,"I Like Fun remains a strong, if not exactly noteworthy album, simply because TMBG are a strong band that can pull off anything at this point, and although newcomers looking for examples of their late-career excellence should probably start with recent gems like Glean or Nanobots, longtime fans will find much to like here, crunchy guitars and all."
Exclaim,Between Two Shores,80,"Recorded in France and produced by Frames guitarist David Odlum, this is expertly crafted and lushly arranged folk-rock, with some pretty fabulous horns."
Exclaim,The House,80,Maine's ability to draw out peculiar emotions and thoughtfully pairing them with euphoric sounds in a deliberate way makes The House a natural and more than satisfying sequel to Pool.
Exclaim,The  Official Body,60,"Unfortunately, The Official Body remains confined to rudimentary rock arrangements and rigid structures. It doesn't reconcile these contradictions until its final three tracks, which makes for restless, if brief, listening in its middle entries."
Exclaim,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,80,"Cogent and catchy all at once, I can feel you creep into my private life shows that, even amid doubt and distress, Tune-Yards can find a new way forward."
Exclaim,Semicircle,70,"Despite this influx of collaborative talent, things sound largely the same on this album, but with a project as reliable as the Go! Team, that's not necessarily a bad thing."
Exclaim,Ruins,80,"Lyrically and sonically, Ruins helps First Aid Kit gives listeners a mature, realized and often heartbreaking version of this young band's oeuvre."
Exclaim,No Cross No Crown,60,"Overall, No Cross No Crown is for diehard fans; those who want to hear something new will be disappointed."
Exclaim,POST-,80,"This album melds its many ideas into some larger parts, with just nine songs clocking in at roughly 40 minutes. But true to form, POST- is still all sorts of bonkers in mostly the right ways."
Exclaim,Rainbow Mirror,80,"Despite occasionally overlong runtimes, Rainbow Mirror is an album that encourages introspection and submerging oneself in their unconscious. It's a monument that both inspires and terrifies."
Exclaim,Full Closure and No Details,70,Full Closure and No Details feels more like a journey to the closure Cohen seeks through her songwriting than an answer itself Š—” and what an important and journey it is.
Exclaim,Tommy [EP],70,"Through fragmentation, each track finds cohesion, making deconstruction Š—” the silences, gaps, twisted repetitions, abrupt cuts, looped production, harried noise--the story itself."
Exclaim,The Emancipation Procrastination,90,"At 34, the New Orleans multi-instrumentalist is too young to have his work described in terms of a career peak, but these albums are so nearly flawless that it's difficult to imagine how he can get any better."
Exclaim,Super Slimey [Mixtape],60,"Similar to how Drake and Future on What a Time to Be Alive, the two collaborators have trouble finding common ground here. They're equally impressive in their own right but they rarely connect, and when they try on each other's styles, it's awkward."
Exclaim,Afternooners,80,"While previous instalments Muscle Up and School Daze were comprised of early, experimental college compositions, Afternooners is more focused and assured."
Exclaim,"Lost at Last, Vol. 1",50,"Tracks like the rambling ""Old Things,"" the hoedown-lite ""Bluebird"" and perhaps the most precious song about outlaw life, ""Private Property,"" shoot for middle-of-the-road appreciation, sucking out any grit from the recording."
Exclaim,Pressure,80,"His latest LP, the 13-song Pressure, is a quality collection of songs that core fans will undoubtedly embrace."
Exclaim,Pop 2 [Mixtape],70,"Like the 6 God's ""playlist,"" this mixtape has no higher purpose than to let its creators run wild, showcasing their prodigious talents with frequent moments of pop brilliance."
Exclaim,Revival,60,"We can say that the real Slim Shady does show up and prove himself on a handful of Revival's songs, but many of the more 'noteworthy' moments are buried under a mountain of contradictions and cringe-worthy attempts at shock value."
Exclaim,No One Ever Really Dies,80,"As anarchic as it may seem on first listen, No_One Every Really Dies smoothes out a little more with each play. It's a strong comeback for the daring trio."
Punknews.org (Staff),Clone of the Universe,80,"On Clone of the Universe, Fu Manchu finds a good balance. They give fans what they crave along with something more unexpected."
Punknews.org (Staff),No Cross No Crown,80,"Guitarist/vocalist Pepper Keenan, guitarist Woody Weatherman, bassist Mike Dean and drummer Reed Mullin still have an undeniable chemistry, and No Cross No Crown is a satisfying return to form."
Punknews.org (Staff),Guppy,70,Guppy as a debut does have room for growth but it's a distinct statement that matches the highs that Hendricks hits and the ambitions of a band whose cult following surely expanded this year.
Punknews.org (Staff),A Hairshirt Of Purpose,70,"While not holding up to Pile's highly-regarded past, still hits hard and reminds you why Pile deserves much more time in the limelight."
Punknews.org (Staff),Relatives in Descent,80,"Relatives in Descent is a gloomy, menacing album, not for the listener looking for a good time. But from pointing out issues within their home city of Detroit to the disastrous place the world is in, Protomartyr are too smart to ignore the problems in the world. They are watching it burn and giving you their take in elaborate, intricate detail."
Punknews.org (Staff),A Walk With Love and Death,80,"Melvins still have something profound to say about the MelvinsŠ—_ but then again, a double disc album that includes one full disc of noise experiments and one full disc of BB King level musicianship kind of was a shocker."
Punknews.org (Staff),Interiors,80,"All set to buzzy guitars and a bass-kit dynamic that adds so much oomph and clout to a band that, well, doesn't really have to do much to get you going. Dive in and see if you emerge alive."
Punknews.org (Staff),Birdie,70,"A few tracks run a bit boring and slightly monotonous but you've got the synth-traced ""Shapes I Know"" paying homage to acts like Conor Oberst and Max Bemis, ""Buttercup"" for fans of John K. Samson, and songs like ""Phoenix"" for when Ewald wants to explore his inner Elliott Smith or Sufjan Stevens. In these 10 tracks, you get a lot closer with him than you do in Modern Baseball's narrative which feels much more wholesale as opposed to Ewald's new musical therapy sessions."
Punknews.org (Staff),Turn Out the Lights,80,"Turn Out The Lights is a powerful listen, teaching you to live with your failures and fears, and to move from coping with them to actually loving them."
Punknews.org (Staff),III,80,"What matters though is that their catchy magic never dies down, rearranging all your emotions on the way and relating to you with the heartfelt comfort of a truly kindred spirit. III delivers just that, starting slowly but eventually snowballing into your soul with an indescribable fire."
Punknews.org (Staff),Strange Peace,80,Alex Edkins' vocals shine like never before with Metz's exposed sound bringing a grainy and emotional feel that the old albums crafted but which Strange Peace maximizes.
Punknews.org (Staff),Going Grey,70,Going Grey isn't gold but it's definitely bright in terms of their future.
Punknews.org (Staff),Prophets of Rage,40,"This album and The Party's Over share many of the same problems that the band can't seem to shake off. Whether you were fan of Public Enemy, Cypress Hill or Rage Against The Machine first I think you'll agree that this whole project just comes off as clumsy."
Punknews.org (Staff),As You Please,90,"Upon first listen, the album may not seem like the next step in the band's career but upon further inspection, the album feels like the next necessary move. Mat Kerekes vocals really shine through on this record as they always do. This is definitely something to listen to if you enjoy Run For Cover Records bands or Citizen."
Punknews.org (Staff),Sterilize,70,This is a cohesive unit firing on all cylinders.
Punknews.org (Staff),Luciferian Towers,60,"While Luciferian Towers evokes a lot of gorgeous imagery to soothe the soul, it lacks a lot of inventiveness and imagination I usually associate with the band."
Punknews.org (Staff),Exile in the Outer Ring,80,"While this album isn't what most people would consider rock, it definitely challenges the listener and succeeds at creating a world for the characters that occupy these songs and making the listener feel like they're there for the experience themselves."
Punknews.org (Staff),Always Foreign,80,It's not loud or in-your-face. It's not preachy. Their stance is subtle yet strong.
Punknews.org (Staff),BRVNX (V),80,IV is a worthy return that shows the Bronx still have those chops.
Punknews.org (Staff),Outrage! Is Now,70,"The arrangements are much tighter, the lyrics feel fleshed out in a time where we can't help but be cynical of humans, and overall what you get from Sebastien Grainger and Jesse Keeler is a buzzy spin on the rock genre that feels like two dudes just chilling while the apocalypse hits and everyone's running around with their heads on fire."
Punknews.org (Staff),Sleep Well Beast,80,"Sleep Well Beast is a heartfelt confession plucked straight from a middle-aged couple's diary on how good and bad things get, how we feel to leave at these tragic moments, how death touches us from that moment we learn to love, but most of all, it teaches us that love is worth fighting for and work has to be put in. No matter what."
Punknews.org (Staff),Antisocialites,80,"Antisocialites feels like rebellion but it does end up conforming to the heart, which will become more weathered as Rankin moves along."
Punknews.org (Staff),A Deeper Understanding,70,"Long and loses steam at times, but it delivers."
Punknews.org (Staff),Every Country's Sun,80,"It has enough experimentation in it to throw off fans of old, but Every Country's Sun is a Mogwai album at heart. It's just marching to a different drum. It jars you like the Beasts of No Nation soundtrack but leaves you, as the title implies and wants, much more hopeful."
Punknews.org (Staff),Good Nature,60,"Good Nature is mellow and laid-back, everything they intended it to be. Hopefully, they add a hard rock or indie edge on the next effort as I think that sound suits them better."
Punknews.org (Staff),S/T,90,"This comeback record--the band's first since 2006--feels like their most mature, seasoned and solid body of work to date and also, it feels like they're pressing forward like never before in a world mangled by torn emotions."
Punknews.org (Staff),Science Fiction,80,Science Fiction is one of their most real and most effective pieces of art. Mike Sapone's production was spot on again and the cover of those girls jumping from a balcony more or less sums up what you need to do with this. Close your eyes and jump right in.
Punknews.org (Staff),Dead Cross,80,"Mike Patton fans know to expect the unexpected, and will love this. For Dave Lombardo fans, Dead Cross will be more of a stretch. If you're an open minded hardcore fan (is that an oxymoron?), I can't recommend this enough."
Punknews.org (Staff),Precious Art,80,"While there are unmistakable comparisons to bands like PUP and The Dirty Nil abound, Precious Art rolls on to mesh together a lot of influences while still standing on its own, carving out an identity that's as distinct as it is loud and catchy."
Punknews.org (Staff),A Black Mile to the Surface,70,"This album was inevitable, and while it lacks the substance of old, it's still full of."
E! Online,Rotten Apple,75,"Banks seems determined to launch a one-man revival with perfectly polished tracks like ""Addicted"" and ""Hands Up."""
E! Online,The Information,83,"Along the way, it scores a lot of points, thanks to Nigel Godrich's earthy but twisted production."
E! Online,Sam's Town,58,"[It] offers only occasional flashbacks to the seedy glamour of the debut, instead settling on lightweight MOR clich’©s."
E! Online,Boys And Girls In America,75,"Songs like ""First Night"" and ""You Can Make Him Like You"" conjure up a bit of Springsteen, a bit of Westerberg and far more catchiness than they should rightfully be allowed."
E! Online,The Crane Wife,83,"[The Crane Wife] not only matches past pop glories, in most cases, it tops them."
E! Online,The Open Door,75,Evanescence fans can rest easy knowing The Open Door handily re-creates the sonic storm of the debut.
E! Online,20 Y.O.,58,"Dated songs like ""So Excited"" and ""Do It 2 Me"" end up sounding like they're, well, 20 years old."
E! Online,Release Therapy,50,"Therapy's diagnosis ultimately is not positive, because the disc's split-personality disorder results in too much incoherence."
E! Online,Okonokos [Live],100,"As concert recordings go, this is one of the best."
E! Online,Ben Kweller,75,"While a handful of the songs sound derivative, it's hard to resist the tambourine-enhanced exuberance of standout cuts like ""Penny on the Train Track"" and ""I Gotta Move."""
E! Online,The Captain & The Kid,50,"Unfortunately, it lacks much of the spark and spunk that made the original disc so memorable."
E! Online,The Dutchess,58,Exactly as gratingly infectious as you might expect.
E! Online,Crazy Itch Radio,75,"Crazy and fun, this is for the people who thought Gnarls Barkley's album was a little too tame."
E! Online,Continuum,67,"On ""Waiting on the World to Change,"" Mayer breathily imagines a world where frat boys get off their couches and have people sign petitions. Sigh. A little more of that and less of noodley songs like ""Vultures"" and ""Gravity"" would have been a good step toward reminding us who Mayer really is."
E! Online,FutureSex / LoveSounds,50,FutureSex/LoveSounds isn't nearly as good as its slinky predecessor.
E! Online,Magic Potion,83,"The group sounds as wonderfully debauched, degenerate and dejected as ever."
E! Online,Face The Promise,75,Thoroughly enjoyable.
E! Online,Revelations,58,The actual music merely offers more of the same oddly faceless brand of heavy rock the group has been cranking out since its 2002 debut.
E! Online,B'Day,42,Appallingly not so good.
E! Online,Modern Times,67,"The veteran singer-songwriter has opted to retreat into old-timey blues, rattling off clich’©s about blind horses and hog-eyed towns while laying down a halfhearted soundtrack of brushed drums, plucked guitars and woozy strings."
E! Online,Game Theory,75,[This] downcast disc is actually an improvement on its predecessor.
E! Online,4:21 ... The Day After,67,The Day After sounds like something we've heard before.
E! Online,Idlewild,100,"Idlewild is a more down-tempo affair than its genre-splitting predecessor, but it wins points with stone-cold psychedelic soul classics such as ""Mighty O,"" ""Peaches"" and ""Hollywood Divorce."""
E! Online,Paris,67,"Listening to her debut album, you get the feeling that she breezed in and out of the studio."
E! Online,Kelis Was Here,67,The result? An album that could just as easily bear the name of any other pop singer working the charts today.
E! Online,Back To Basics,67,It's too much.
E! Online,Second Round's On Me,50,"Only the faux-reggae of ""Jamaican Girl"" lets some much needed light in between the blinds."
E! Online,(One),42,It's hard to believe these men were once innovators.
E! Online,Waterloo To Anywhere,75,"Of course, it sounds ragged as all hell, but that was half of his old band's charm."
E! Online,Reprieve,67,An arresting mix of the singer's political and personal strife set to a jazzy backbeat.
Pitchfork,Chris Dave and the Drumhedz,62,Chris Dave's accomplished chops demand that he should be the star of his debut--but too often he's lost in the firmament.
Pitchfork,Rock Island,68,"Their second album, Rock Island, shows Palm working harder than ever to unburden themselves of the influences heard on those earlier releases, from Slint and Sonic Youth to Battles and Animal Collective."
Pitchfork,Pure Beauty,63,"The visual [video] gambit falls uneasily between a critique of hip-hop's relationship with corporate sportswear brands and, once again, a flimsy attempt to muster up attention. Pure Beauty plays out in a similar fashion, committing wholly to neither SHIRT's appealing raw rap chops nor his grander concepts."
Pitchfork,Dead Start Program,65,"Although the record has a number of aesthetically appealing moments, Dead Start Program never quite coalesces."
Pitchfork,Crooked Shadows,47,"With Crooked Shadows, Carrabba aims to bring together his competing production impulses. Unfortunately, the results are all over the place."
Pitchfork,Go Dig My Grave,60,"When Wallumr’Ùd emerges from the long shadows of her source material, elevate Go Dig My Grave beyond the beautifully rendered, if rather pointless, collection of covers it sometimes threatens to be."
Pitchfork,Transangelic Exodus,74,"His fourth solo album, Transangelic Exodus, is his most thematically cohesive work to date: a loose narrative about supernatural queer lovers on the run from the law. The misfit feelings surging through his back catalog crystallize here into detailed imagery, giving the album a lurid, cinematic sheen."
Pitchfork,Black Panther: The Album,75,"It's fitting that this slightly convoluted, sometimes generic offering largely delivers on its promise, much like the larger comic world it now occupies. A fun, rap-centric album is now Marvel canon. In their first roles as bit players, the TDE roster delivers a product benefiting the whole. Their effort is one befitting the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and its blackest entry."
Pitchfork,Beautiful Despair,69,"Beautiful Despair is a rough sketch, and its worth extends only as far as one's interest in such a document."
Pitchfork,The  Two Worlds,74,"The Two Worlds finds ways to communicate between these modes [fantasy and emotional urgency], interior and exterior, resulting in a portrait that feels full and honest."
Pitchfork,Little Dark Age,70,"If Little Dark Age is a new start, it's a promising one."
Pitchfork,Air Lows,70,"Her fifth full-length Air Lows feels like a goth psychedelic ritual intended to plumb the depths of the listener's unconscious; while the record doesn't always hit its mark, the moments that do sustain momentum radiate a delectably gnostic hum."
Pitchfork,Dream Wife,67,"If their debut fails to offer a consistent, forceful message the way their riot grrrl heroes once did, they have at least figured out how to capture some of those predecessors' energy. For now, Dream Wife leaves you revved up and ready to go with nowhere suggested."
Pitchfork,Pissing Stars,78,"Pissing Stars feels purposefully small, a personal retreat from full-band compromise by someone who is trying to understand the world and his role in it. The result is indulgent, neurotic, and harrowing, a reminder of the complete mess we've made. But it's oddly reassuring, too."
Pitchfork,Always Ascending,69,"The return of synths and disco-ish atmospherics serves, unsurprisingly, to obscure the fact that a nontrivial reinvention still eludes them. But to their credit, Franz Ferdinand are persistently resourceful, and in their theatrical suave and helter-skelter choruses there lingers an obvious knack for starting fires armed only with indie-pop panache."
Pitchfork,Criminal,72,"Vasquez's new album, Criminal, batters down the restraints that choked back his voice in the past, letting him break from a whisper into, finally, a scream. If it isn't his most nuanced record, it's certainly his most decisive."
Pitchfork,Phantom Thread [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack],75,"As a standalone suite of songs, like a tuxedo you only dust off every now and then, it is beautiful, but only appropriate when the occasion demands it."
Pitchfork,Quit the Curse,68,"Distinguished by her sure-footed stride, Quit the Curse sounds like an album by an artist who at last knows where she's going."
Pitchfork,Blood,63,"This album often sounds like a studio-crafted simulacrum of a full-band performance, every element a bit too polished."
Pitchfork,Microshift,79,"The adherence to krautrockin' repetition remains, but the proto-punk engine has been replaced by electronic loops and glacial synths. Suddenly, a band that once sounded most at home in strobe-lit basement dives now sounds primed for a late-afternoon slot at your roving summer festival of choice."
Pitchfork,Full Circle Nightmare,41,"On the whole, though, the women Craft expends so much breath obsessing over drift in and out of his songs like cardboard cutouts from a bygone era, there to be lusted after and then blamed when they don't fit into his fantasy."
Pitchfork,Messes,72,"It's easy to indulge a reverie when it's a vivid one, and Messes invites you to lose track of time for awhile with it."
Pitchfork,Lionheart,80,"Lionheart is brought to life by McEntire's soulful voice, by a sweeping Nashville sound, but more so by a deep sense of conviction."
Pitchfork,Open Here,72,"With Open Here, Field Music rises to the challenge with a set of newly crystallized talking points, offered up along with a glorious mess of noise."
Pitchfork,Man of the Woods,38,"Too much of Man of the Woods is musically and thematically shallow; at 66 minutes, it's a mile wide and an inch deep."
Pitchfork,Con Todo El Mundo,76,Khruangbin's takes this new mode of listening and injects its own singular and developing personality into the playlisting of modern music.
Pitchfork,Follow Them True,77,"Follow Them True, Stick in the Wheel continue their attack. About half of the album refines the acoustic folk sound of their debut, with lyrics emphasizing the pride of craftsmen and laborers as well as the desperation driving the poor."
Pitchfork,Love Jail,70,"Love Jail goes beyond a mere glance in the rearview mirror. It sounds vintage, but it feels current. Dommengang find some potential for escape in this music, some freedom in that absence of a destination."
Pitchfork,P2,74,"P2 shows a man who is patient and relentless in honing his craft, getting closer to the debut with each track."
Pitchfork,oh my,66,"Oh My feels like a pocket-sized chapbook set to music: some songs inspire, some feel thin. When NADINE's strange poetry does convince you to dog-ear a song, though, returning to it feels as creatively refreshing as when you heard it for the first time."
The 405,Bonny Doon,75,"Despite the underlying melancholy throughout, Bonny Doon is by no means a downer of an album, and it's due to the winning and classic songwriting tropes Bonny Doon have adhered to."
The 405,Saturation III,80,"This is Brockhampton at their funkiest and most playful, but it's also Brockhampton at their finest."
The 405,Pop 2 [Mixtape],75,"With the exception of the chart beckoning 'Out of My head' with Tove Lo, every track here has the structure of subverted pop destined for the decades beyond."
The 405,No One Ever Really Dies,75,"Some may miss the more rock-influenced days of the group's debut, but Pharrell's more recent taste rules here. It's for the better. NO_ONE EVER REALLY DIES plays like an album length party, with no groove that won't make you want to get off the couch and dance."
The 405,Revival,15,Revival is so uninspired and lost that picking it apart is a hopeless affair.
The 405,Improvisations,60,"It's palatable, well-performed, but rarely involving. It's a shame that the most exciting thing about a collaboration between Charles Hayward and Thurston Moore is that it's a collaboration between Charles Hayward and Thurston Moore."
The 405,Double Or Nothing,55,"While Double or Nothing isn't entirely a miss, it certainly represents a downwards move for Metro Boomin. It makes sense that he'd seek bigger names to experiment with, but the choice of Big Sean was Hallmark safe."
The 405,You Might Be Smiling Now,80,"They've dredged up their youthful feelings and animated them in both honest and affectionate tones, and it makes You Might Be Smiling NowŠ—_ a joyous rummage through swathes of bleary nostalgia."
The 405,Songs of Experience,60,"As a continuation of U2's work at this point in their career, Songs of Experience is a decent addition to their legacy that longtime fans should be generally pleased by. However, it still suffers from the same issues that have made U2 so polarizing in recent years, and is unlikely to change anyone's mind about the band one way or another."
The 405,Soul of a Woman,85,"When all is said and done, Soul of a Woman cements itself as a fitting send-off for a woman who flat-out owned the stage and spearheaded a scene, transcending the notions of 'neo' and 'revival' to make music that was impassioned and pure. Sharon Jones lives on every time you press play."
The 405,Rest,85,"Rest is her gateway out from the darkness, a way of coping with her fragilities, a processor of emotions, her loss, and also her most personal work to date, simply, where Charlotte is finally able to be Charlotte."
The 405,Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light,80,"With this captivating sequel, The Body & Full of Hell have given us something striking that could only have been realized with each other."
The 405,Xenoula,80,"Xenoula is a funky, fresh and downright fun album that comprises many palette-expanding songs for anyone with pop proclivities."
The 405,If All I Was Was Black,80,If All I Was Was Black is often times both troubling and soothing.
The 405,Reflection of Youth,85,"Although sonically ominous, Relfection of Youth possesses a sophisticated breed of optimism which embodies itself through realism."
The 405,(It Was) Because I Was In Love [Deluxe Reissue],70,"Are We There is one of the finest folk-ish albums of this decade, but this timely reissue illustrates that Van Etten's remarkable talent has always been omnipresent. Eight years on, her incoming anxious queries and lovelorn passages are as pertinent as they've ever been."
The 405,Romaplasm,85,"This is perhaps the most simply alive Baths has yet sounded on record, retaining enough of his emotional heft, while allowing for an entirely new collage of flashy, elated songcraft. This is Baths triumphant."
The 405,The Greatest Gift,65,"The Greatest Gift is an appropriate accompaniment to Carrie and Lowell. A simple compilation of oddball tracks, it delivers enough to stand for itself--but is ultimately only really for the enjoyment of Stevens' long-time fans."
The 405,L'Orange L'Orange,75,"L'Orange L'Orange doesn't exist in one place or detail specific events, which is to say it's a fine contrast to the 21st century's culture of volume. It simply is, and that gives it grace."
The 405,Memory of a Cut Off Head,75,Few albums in the Oh Sees catalogue are as emotionally intimate as Memory Of A Cut Off Head.
The 405,Phases,80,"Many of the tracks vary to such a degree that those not acquainted with Olsen would be forgiven for thinking they were not by the same artist, yet to those who appreciate her work, the artist's strong narrative ties the collection together."
The 405,Mechanics of Dominion,65,"Mechanics of Dominion is too heady for its own good, but still holds ground as a wonderful combination of influences and post-genre style. It takes time for it to reveal itself, and it's usually worth the investment."
The 405,Screen Memories,70,"A common pattern on this record? A feeling of positivity and amusement that shines through in almost every song, while still preserving a solemn mood."
The 405,Kid Kruschev,80,"In keeping it short and sour, the normally too giving Sleigh Bells have finally done it: left us wanting."
The 405,Without Warning,80,"While this easily could have been an enjoyable throwaway, with two young artists linking up for the hype and moving it, it beats all odds to stand as one of 2017's most enjoyable and essential moments."
The 405,The Animal Spirits,85,"The record is a lot of things and also unquestionably not, for the most part embodying an impregnable and extraordinary soundscape that fortifies itself against deconstruction, but its one truly distinctive quality is that it's the precise opposite of boring."
The 405,The Dusk in Us,95,"On The Dusk In Us, we have a handful of tracks that see Converge pushing at the boundaries of their sound, even escaping it entirely. This leads to some of the most accessible, catchy, and (uncoincidentally) most emotionally resonant work of their careers."
The 405,Backwater,75,"Backwater being their most complete and mature release to date, the band's creative dynamic remains organic and allows them to adjust themselves to a rhythm of their choosing, as they evolve as musicians and as a two-piece band with a wide range of possibilities."
The 405,Plunge,85,"She seems a lot happier, or at least more energetic and outgoing, coming into second album Plunge. But that only seems to bring her up against more frustrations in the world around her, which are wrought vividly throughout."
The 405,The Endless Shimmering,80,"The Endless Shimmering is such a relief to listen to. It's not just a correction for the band, it's also a redemption and a potential catalyst for an exciting new stage in their career as instrumental rock leaders."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Run the Jewels,83,"Ultimately, this is sound of two dons recognising their rightful place at the top of the summit, surveying their kingdom and proceeding to piss all over it. And it sounds fucking glorious."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Unreal,79,"Fans of Yuck who are coming into Unreal hoping for and album as plentiful of hooks as that album might be slightly perturbed at first not to find anything as tight or punchy as something like 'Get Away' or 'The Wall,' but after spending time with the album you'll find that each song possesses an airy, sing-songy hook that's easy to latch onto."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Kveikur,84,"Kveikur is the band's noisiest and most muscular record yet. The variety of experience it offers not just from Valtari, but from the band's entire catalogue, means that it stands among their best."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Saaab Stories [EP],70,"Saab Stories is the least appealing of those [albums], but that has less to do with the rapper and more to do with the production which doesn't allow this extra-large personality to conflate alongside it. Action Bronson is a big man; he just needs room to breathe."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Embracism,72,"Embracism is a record that'll grab you and bring you close, but also one that won't hesitate to push you away with a gut punch and expect you to take it like a man."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Ghost Systems Rave,77,"It's big, heavy, and worthy to soundtrack plenty of dancefloors. The only thing Ghost System Rave is arguably missing is the real personality from its creators."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Olympia,78,The growth in Austra from Feel It Break to Olympia is palpable throughout.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),This Is Another Life,66,"The music on This Is Another Life isn't the kind that boasts colour, or even deep and dark hues, but rather is full of big strokes of dull greys."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Apocalypse,86,There's a wealth of sonic variety on display but the concise run-time--clocking in at a fraction over 40 minutes--keeps matters focused and thoroughly engaging.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Soft Will,80,"Soft Will is certainly not as immediately infectious as Smith Westerns' previous outings, but that does not make it a weaker album. There are still many injections of fun in the wordless gang vocals and theatrical guitar solos."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Sunbather,92,"Sunbather is a future classic, no matter where you pigeonhole it, and that's the mark of a true sonic masterpiece. Black metal, not black metal, just call it what it is: perfect."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Immunity,87,"All in all, Hopkins' roadmap is splendidly plotted, taking the right amount of time to deliver you to your destination and showing you the detours you didn't even know you wanted to see."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Kids in L.A.,64,"Fair play to them for expanding out on Kids in L.A. and finding appropriate inspiration, but I dare say that the emotion that brought the couple together seem to be their deepest well of inspiration."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Yeezus,88,"If there's anything Mr. West finds completely alien to his person, it's restraint, and Yeezus is the perfect, chaotic, and ultimately uncompromising dive into this world."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Born Sinner,68,"If Born Sinner proves anything, it's that he's not ready to take the fall, but he as a long way to go if he wants to rope off an area all his own in hip hop's evolution."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Field of Reeds,77,"Pinned up and thoroughly artistic, Field of Reeds is affecting, but it's also hard to get genuinely excited about."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Some Say I So I Say Light,80,"As his name implies, Ghostpoet can be vague, mystifying, and a little bit of a downer--but ultimately the best art is the kind that makes you think and broadens your perspective, which this record does in spades."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Desire Lines,74,"Desire Lines is undoubtedly a Camera Obscura album, but it might be their first that is more suited to quiet winter nights inside, rather than the sunny side of things that dominated their sound on their previous albums."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Drifters/Love Is the Devil,86,"He's fulfilled every promise made by Badlands and then some, and despite whatever depths of pain made such an eruption of shattered awesome possible, he's managed not just one of the best albums of the year, but one of the most genuinely moving, as well."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Crawling Up the Stairs,80,"Crawling Up The Stairs should be praised not only for its beauty, honesty and sonic specialty, but also for the way it's sequenced."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Cold Spring Fault Less Youth,83,"Each track posseses different sounds, colours, styles and textures, but they combine to make an odd but strangely appealing whole."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Tomorrow's Harvest,87,"Where Music Has the Right seemed grounded in the real world (albeit a twisted recollection of such) and Geogaddi straddled the line between Star Wars and The Sandlot, Tomorrow's Harvest finds the duo launching their sound into Lovecraftian orbit. And it sounds terrific."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Settle,87,It's one of the most gleeful and replayable debuts of 2013.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),...Like Clockwork,80,"Now on the other side of forty, this is QOTSA as weary of mortality as they've ever been. They also sound as vital, forceful and rough around the edges as they have in over a decade. Welcome back, gentlemen."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),MCII,85,"On MCII, it's a dual-edged sword that he brandishes skillfully into a scintillating sophomore record, one stacked with some of the year's best pop-rock tunes."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Once I Was an Eagle,80,"Eagle is definitely Marling's most considered work, and most of that comes simply from the fact she's stripped away a lot of the decoration, and yet ultimately it feels easy for her, if not a little predictable."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Nocturnes,59,"Nocturnes rates better as an album that sounds better with time, as opposed to Hands' sugar rush appeal. However, it also retains an uneven quality that can make getting through Nocturnes feel like someone trying to drag the party on a little too long."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Impersonator,86,"An aura of mystery and ambiguity hangs over Impersonator. The emotions and resulting thoughts are always present and felt, but their cause isn't always clear."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Abandon [EP],85,"Abandon is one of the most cathartic, brutalizing, and beautiful experimental releases this or any year."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Innocence is Kinky,85,"[A] sprawling, at times impenetrable, but most outstandingly, engaging ramble."
Kerrang!,Hiss Spun,80,"Truly, Chelsea Wolfe has hit upon something very heavy here--something that'll haunt your nightmares long after it ends. [7 Oct 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Pinewood Smile,80,"In their own way The Darkness, enthusiastically blending banter and bombast in equal measure, are proving as much fun [as Queen]. [7 Oct 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Cold Dark Place [EP],80,"Immediate heaviosity is in short supply, but Cold dark Place instead offers plenty of alternate impact. [30 Sep 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Gossip,60,"Sure, the songs sound unique to SWS because of their singer's inimitable voice, but several of the tracks are reminiscent of other artists. [23 Sep 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Visions of a Life,80,"The eclectic sounds of Wolf Alice's debut made them stars, but this sequel finds them doing everything bigger and better. [2 Sep 2017, p.51]"

Kerrang!,Strange Peace,60,"Escalator Teeth, meanwhile, is another short, stabbing moment of clarity. The rest is largely exhilarating and occasionally meandering. More of the same, then, which is entirely the point. [23 Sep 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Mareridt,80,"Leaps and bounds ahead of their excellent M debut, Mareridt is ambitious, accomplished, and beautifully ugly. [16 Sep 2017, p.53]"

Kerrang!,Outrage! Is Now,80,"This one's a reduction of their dense, danceable punk rock into two main groups: lairy and louche. [9 Sep 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Prophets of Rage,80,"An outfit possessed of a murderous groove. [9 Sep 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Concrete and Gold,80,"If you're expecting an album full of immediate anthems like Monkey Wrench and All My Life, dig out their Greatest Hits. Otherwise, bask in this hour of masterful '70s-flavoured jams. [9 Sep 2017, p.50]"

Kerrang!,The Rise of Chaos,80,"Bangers like Die By The Sword and Hole In The Head share not only the four syllable song titles of the Balls To The Wall/Fast As A Shark Days; they're chock-full of those classics' runaway riffage, searing solos and tooth-cracking attitude, too. [5 Aug 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Villains,80,"Villains makes for a compelling lane change, finding the impetus to bring an interesting makeover. [12 Aug 2017, p.50]"

Kerrang!,Dead Reflection,20,"The result is a collection of undignified Pierce The Veil-lite songs that are fitted with all the bells and whistles, but absolutely none of the quality that makes that band successful. [8 Jul 2017, p.52]"
Splendid,Field Music,80,"Instead of embracing the angularity of the self-conscious Britpop and New Wave scenes of yore, Field Music embrace the sugary pop-rock that defined the first British Invasion."
Splendid,Generation,80,"By returning to the drawing board they used to create Ego War, Dinsdale and Franks have created a bigger, better version of their all-inclusive dance-pop/hip-hop."
Splendid,A Colores,70,"Though A Colores is rather uneven, it's a compelling-- and more than competent-- effort."
Splendid,Recording A Tape The Colour Of The Light,70,"Bell Orchestre don't always make good on their ambitions, but the results are often excellent, despite (and usually because of) their sloppiness."
Splendid,Father Divine,80,Father Divine is that rare album that's conscious of its diversity without being pretentious about it
Splendid,Akron/Family & Angels Of Light,90,"It is completely different from either Akron/Family's or Angels of Light's work from earlier this year, and in Akron's case, represents a startling pace of artistic development."
Splendid,Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow,80,"As you've come to expect, a small amount of the material sounds utterly fantastic and there's a solid chunk that's barely audible, but whether it's delivered with a coating of fuzz or a liberal gloss of studio sheen, Pollard's gumdrop melodies and fantastical lyrical phrasing keep us coming back for more."
Splendid,Lookaftering,90,"There are very few artists who could pick up where they left off after ten years, or even five. To do this after half a lifetime is extraordinary."
Splendid,Descended Like Vultures,50,"While the Big Chorus and post-hardcore theatricality are hardly disparate stylistic traits, it's odd that Rogue Wave would embrace them after establishing themselves as a nuanced pop outfit."
Splendid,Feels,90,This is a wonderful album -- and a significant advance over the excellent Sung Tongs.
Splendid,Hypermagic Mountain,80,"There are no breathers in Hypermagic Mountain. There are only a series of knuckle sandwiches in the form of throbbing, distorting, gesticulating low-end ear bleeders."
Splendid,Tanglewood Numbers,80,"Tanglewood Numbers' hummable songs and often-arresting lyrics are impressive, but Berman would be nowhere without a little help from his many friends."
Splendid,Hey People!,70,"If you like it fast and rough and dirty, this one's for you"
Splendid,Strange Geometry,70,"The Clientele have crafted another lovely batch of tunes, perfect for autumnal introspection and wintry solitude -- but somehow it doesn't seem like enough."
Splendid,Tournament Of Hearts,90,"The most remarkable thing about Tournament of Hearts is that technically, it is the Constantines' slowest, jazziest, most countrified release to date, but it doesn't give an inch of intensity when it's compared to their self-titled debut or the landmark Shine a Light."
Splendid,The Mouse And The Mask,90,"Rather than detract from the funkified weirdness, the guest spots from the Adult Swim crew actually add to the craziness."
Splendid,Shamelessly Exciting,80,"It's everything we've come to expect from Forrest in one gloriously hack 'n' sawed package, meticulously pieced together from his wide-ranging record collection."
Splendid,Dangerous And Moving,40,"Julia and Lena's voices are nothing special, and their lyrics are still derivative -- suitable fodder for Charmed or a Rachel Leigh Cook movie, but not the sort of thing that makes a lasting impression."
Splendid,Gimmie Trouble,70,Gimmie Trouble reminds us that Adult. don't sound like anyone else... Not even themselves.
Splendid,dios (malos),90,"Through smart songcraft, a powerful command of pop vocabulary, and skillful track sequencing, Dios Malos deliver an album that expands and grows more complicated with every listen."
Splendid,"Thunder, Lightning, Strike",90,This is one of those rare albums where every single track is a keeper and killer hooks abound.
Splendid,Witching Hour,80,"Here, finally, is a goth album for people who hate goth, an electronic album for people who hate electronica, and a pop album for everyone else."
Splendid,Z,80,The first My Morning Jacket whose songs reach the heights to which James's voice aspires.
Splendid,You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having,70,"Slug hasn't grown a whole lot.... Still, his lyricism and delivery are generally smart and entertaining, and Ant's production goes even further toward making You Can't Imagine... a thoroughly enjoyable record."
Splendid,Live It Out,90,"Metric take rock 'n' roll to a smarter, more sophisticated place than do most of today's American bands."
Splendid,Albatross,80,"You'd think there wasn't much left to do with the roots-oriented rock formula, but Albatross proves that there's plenty of life and passion and intelligence left in the genre."
Splendid,In Space,70,"This isn't really one of those cases where bands like Wire or Mission of Burma or Vashti Bunyan come back years later with stuff that ranks among their best, but it isn't bad, either -- not bad at all."
Splendid,The Antidote,50,"After a while, the songs begin to sound the same, and while Martey's vocals are consistently strong, the fact that she almost always sings in the same range robs them of much of their effect."
Splendid,Apologies To The Queen Mary,80,"Apologies to the Queen Mary is almost an hour long, and there are certainly portions of it that aren't essential... but it's difficult to see where any fat could have been cut, as each track has its own fractured beauty."
Splendid,Collisions,80,"The album sounds mature, weathered, tired and occasionally almost weary, but is far to dynamic to ever seem truly lethargic."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Nomad,91,"With an American bassist on half the tracks and a German drummer doubling Bombino's own guy half the time too, this is the hardest-rocking of the hard-traveling Tuareg guitarist's three distinct albums."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Jama Ko,100,"Two melodies reach back centuries. Strong-voiced frontwoman Amy Sacko delivers the word. And although the ngoni is a mere lute, Kouyate gets more noises you want to hear out of his strings than any two jam-band hotshots you can name."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Cerulean Salt,91,"Sometimes we believe we care, what happens in the tuneful drywall of her shambling dreams."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Girl Talk,91,"[I'm] prouder, frankly, when this likable size 12 lets her voice crack all over the big fat scarewords ""feminist"" and ""sexism"" on an album that gets dissed for its simplistic songwriting as if that wasn't the point."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),D.A.I.S.Y. Rage [EP],91,"She raps better now, shaping her breathy little-girl pout into vulnerability and defiance as circumstances dictate, which often means simultaneously. She rhymes better too."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Same Trailer Different Park,91,"The finest lyricist to rise up out of conscious country since Miranda Lambert, if not Bobby Pinson himself."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Long.Live.A$AP,83,"Rocky raps over the music without saying a damn thing older, meaner, and sharper rappers haven't said before. Then, bang, three dynamite songs.... Then, aww, three tracks that could be more obvious by half."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),100 Proof,83,American Idol haunts this artistic breakthrough.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Like a Rose,91,Slowly you'll realize just how rare it is for a major-label Nashville hopeful to put this much care into every song even if you're not convinced by the one that connects whipped cream and whips.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),An Awesome Wave,83,This Leeds-to-Cambridge foursome's unhurried electro-mesh is always more than pleasant and half the time mildly enthralling.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Light Up Gold,91,"The hook on these 14 two-minute songs isn't tunes except occasionally. It's whichever of the two guys who ""sing, if you must call it that"" comes packing the most anxiety."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),No Love Deep Web,91,"There's more space in these tracks, and unlikely hints of sweetening both orchestral and distaff that come as laugh moments whether the lunatics running the asylum think they're funny or not."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Fear Fun,83,"Though he dumbs up his songwriting half the time by fearing fun literally as regards forward motion, don't give up."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The Grifter's Hymnal,91,"The follow-up is his party record, and deeper as a consequence, dark and hilarious and gone so fast you're too busy tapping your inner foot to cavil about pitch or timbre."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The Evil Empire of Everything,83,"Midway through, here comes some madman with the deeply stoopid ""31 Flavors"" and you realize it wasn't going along fine enough."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Falling Off the Sky,91,It's like H&S [Holsapple & Stamey] never went away.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Fade,91,Their quietest and most fragile album is also their most orchestrated.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Heroes,83,"I decided that Lukas's stoned-hillbilly affect was just what his dad needed to distinguish this particular assortment of what-thes, why-hasn't-he-evers,&#8203; and written-to-orders from rival entries in his unchartable catalogue."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Kaleidoscope Dream,91,"He's major now, and musically, this locks in top to bottom."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Wild Water Kingdom [Mixtape],91,"Although more far-out referents might arguably block my passway to his freewheeling freestyles, subcontinental beats like Keyboard Kid's electro-Carnatic ""Let It Go"" and Harry Fraud's serpent-charming ""Wild Water Kingdom"" mean to create a world of fun for everyone."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),51,83,"True, the record shudders to a virtual halt when the ecumenical auteur turns beatmaker midway through, and some may judge the rhymes irresponsibly playful."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),"The Greatest Story Never Told, Chapter 2: Bread And Circuses",91,"Almost nothing here dips to ordinary. And beats or not, one reason is that the rapper's rough clarity is musical bedrock."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City",91,"The atmospheric beats Dr. Dre and his hirelings lay under the raps and choruses establish musical continuity, shoring  up a nervous flow that's just what Lamar's rhymes need."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Lonely At the Top,91,"On his fourth and least austere album ventures into songlike territory without ever enlisting a vocalist, although vocal sounds do enter the mix."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Stunt Rhythms,91,"Reminds me of a painter pal who in the '60s did a whole slipcase of polarized bicolor sex silkscreens--some lovely, some gross, all yummy."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Sunken Condos,91,"You'll grow to love the queen of Bowlmor Lanes, the Jazz Age gangster who takes pride in his work, the souvenirs of dooms past rusting in the back of the sci-fi shop."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Red,91,"I like the feisty ones, as I generally do. But ""Begin Again"" and especially ""Stay Stay Stay"" stay happy and hit just as hard."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),First of a Living Breed,91,"Between speed of delivery and brevity of line, Sandman's nonstop tunefulness here tends jingly no matter how gritty his flow."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Transcendental Youth,100,"Matthew E. White's horn charts are the musical development Darnielle has in store for us. But the dealmaker is Jon Wurster's spare, inescapable drumming."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Call Me Sylvia,91,They add muscle to their sound and lose a smidgen of edge in their writing.
The Boston Phoenix,Grace/Confusion,75,"The disc's six tracks clock in at less than 40 minutes, so there isn't really time to screw things up on a royal scale, making Grace/Confusion a fine listen."
The Boston Phoenix,Bish Bosch,37,"Call it what you want, just be prepared to call it something other than music."
The Boston Phoenix,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded--the Re-Up,88,"Special note to the freakazoids who think ""Starships"" killed hip-hop: the rapper who rhymes ""fri-vo-lous"" with ""po-ly-ga-mist"" is X-Acto sharp as ever."
The Boston Phoenix,The Odds,88,Their third record proves that even the most militant punk songs are often best served by a stripped-down aesthetic.
The Boston Phoenix,Trilogy,75,"Even at Tesfaye's most awkward, it's impossible not to be intoxicated."
The Boston Phoenix,Lonerism,88,Lonerism is a life raft for the abyss of song-induced self-reflection it inspires.
The Boston Phoenix,House on the Hill,63,"The songs are what we've come to expect--approachable slacker jams mixed in with cursory love songs, and the occasional guitar solo that proves reverb and washed-out colors don't have the monopoly on nostalgia--but production is cleaner and energy levels are lower."
The Boston Phoenix,Temporal,75,Temporal as a whole is evenly mastered and gratifyingly titanic.
The Boston Phoenix,Koi No Yokan,88,"Koi No Yokan is not only the year's best metal-rock-space-pop album--it's also the finest Deftones album, front to back, to date."
The Boston Phoenix,The Inner Mansions,75,The Inner Mansions is much more interesting than your typical bedroom pop album.
The Boston Phoenix,King Animal,75,"On the whole, King Animal is a welcome return, and though it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it reminds us why these guys were considered the architects of the Seattle scene."
The Boston Phoenix,Just To Feel Anything,63,"The Ohio trio took their time with Feel Anything, arriving at this more focused, albeit less celestial, effort."
The Boston Phoenix,Top Ten Hits of the End of the World,88,"The music is what matters, and Prince Rama, with this highfalutin' silliness, have delivered big."
The Boston Phoenix,Music From Another Dimension!,37,"With tracks like ""LUV XXX,"" ""Beautiful,"" and ""Lover Alot,"" everyone's favorite dude-looks-like-a-grandma just can't let go of that screechy horndog rock."
The Boston Phoenix,Zeros,88,"It's a minimalist approach that started on the Soft Moon's outstanding 2010 self-titled debut full-length, and continues here with each composition taking on an overall instrumental feel despite the occasional presence of lyrical accompaniment."
The Boston Phoenix,Last of a Dyin' Breed,0,"On Dyin' Breed, they stoop to some depressing new lows."
The Boston Phoenix,Pink,100,"Ironically, this patchwork of 12-inch singles is Kieran Hebden's most delectable album-as-album."
The Boston Phoenix,"Mumps, Etc.",37,Lifeless and boring.
The Boston Phoenix,Banks,63,"Even though the album's zany unpredictability can be thrilling, it often feels like Banks is adorning vacant tunes (""Arise Awake,"" the plodding instrumental ""Another Chance"") with bells and whistles."
The Boston Phoenix,Free Dimensional,63,"Everything about Free Dimensional is cheesy--from the mousey bedroom beats to the predictable synth lines to O'Regan's (hard) Soft Cell vocal delivery to the awkward, bumbling raps. Regardless, several songs are stunning."
The Boston Phoenix,Local Business,88,Patrick Stickles finally overworks his music to match his trying-too-hard fables.
The Boston Phoenix,The  Haunted Man,75,"Khan might be getting bolder, bigger, and more experimental, but pushing past what everyone expects or wants from you as an artist sometimes works - even the third time around."
The Boston Phoenix,Cobra Juicy,75,"In sacrificing weirdness for conformity, Cobra Juicy shows growth, but somewhat mugs the band of what made them so singular."
The Boston Phoenix,Former Lives,75,"Gibbard's carving out new musical territory on Former Lives, while amplifying the broken heart of what makes his sound so wonderful."
The Boston Phoenix,Soft Fall,75,"Glossy and palatable, but also decidedly sophisticated."
The Boston Phoenix,Until the Quiet Comes,75,"Ellison excels everywhere else, keeping the beats brisk and the instrumentation organic and lively."
The Boston Phoenix,Who Needs Who,75,"Art-pop triumph ""Tell Me"" puts it all over the top as the zenith of Triple D's young career. That's something to be optimistic about."
The Boston Phoenix,End of Daze [EP],63,The album's listlessness - when compared to the blisteringly restless heartbreak/firecracker of Dreams - is kind of a bummer.
The Boston Phoenix,Babel,50,"Individually, these songs pack an emotional wallop, performed with a passion that is rare in today's indie-rock scene of disconnected cool. But taken as a giant lump, they're exhausting dead-ends: 12 straight climaxes cancel each other out - and Babel could use a little rising action."
The Boston Phoenix,Shields,88,"On Shields, they achieve a fluid synthesis: Rossen and Droste still share vocal duties, but they often tag-team the same track, trading off lines and writing melodies for one another's voices. Their styles coalesce so smoothly, it's often difficult to tell where one singer-songwriter starts and the other ends."
Paste Magazine,Bajas Fresh,88,"It's easy to coast, but Bitchin Bajas consistently strive. It's a pleasure to try to keep up with 'em."
Paste Magazine,Versatile,76,"It's the originals that shine the most, a testament to the talent of a songwriter that has written a standard or two of his own."
Paste Magazine,Xenoula,79,"Throughout much of the album, Xeno and Dust sound stuck between pop and avant garde. Here, the commit to the latter, with promising results. That's Xenoula in a nutshell: Often weird. Oddly pretty. Always full of promise."
Paste Magazine,Rest,86,"Like Charlotte Gainsbourg's entire musical career, Rest is imperfect, but it's intriguing enough that you can't help but pay attention. And now that she's pouring more of herself into her songs, her work feels weightier, more complex, and more compelling."
Paste Magazine,The Greatest Gift,76,"The bottom line with The Greatest Gift is predictable. Big Sufjan fans need it, others probably don't."
Paste Magazine,Memory of a Cut Off Head,84,"Depending on where you fall on a scale from one to hardcore fan, this creates either a masterful, cohesive soundscape--or a monotonous departure from the frenzied, fuzzed-out energy of Dwyer's most well-known songs."
Paste Magazine,Low in High School,51,Mmost frustrating about this album are the shades of old Morrissey.
Paste Magazine,If All I Was Was Black,84,"So Black is a heavy record, but there are bright moments sprinkled throughout."
Paste Magazine,Soul of a Woman,87,Soul Of A Woman offers up a piece of everything that made Jones a powerhouse up to the very end.
Paste Magazine,Automatic for the People [25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition],94,"Moments of levity ('The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite' and 'Man On The Moon') and righteous anger ('Ignoreland') cleared the sinuses but otherwise, the tone of Automatic is marked by doughy pressure and woozy beauty. The remastered version of the LP brings that to the fore as well as emphasizing the skin-tingling intimacy of Michael Stipe's vocals throughout. ... This expanded edition of the album (three CDs and a blu-ray disc featuring all the promotional videos and the album mixed in Dolby ATMOS) offers a more fully-rounded understanding of Automatic."
Paste Magazine,Out of Range,88,"This band can make a brisk song feel expansive, and it knows how to inject a slow song with unmistakable urgency. You don't learn how to do that... or at least it's not easy to learn it. You just have it. Gun Outfit has it, and they wield it with great skill."
Paste Magazine,Wild and Reckless,74,"Wild & Reckless takes a couple steps in the right direction. This band's optimum path, however, is still several steps away."
Paste Magazine,Unapologetically,81,"Unapologetically gains in strength as it goes along, mirroring Ballerini's push away from a particular lover and towards the welcoming arms of a new beau."
Paste Magazine,Phases,76,"If Phases proves anything, it's that Olsen's discards are better than a lot of artists' best efforts. Like her name suggests, she seems otherworldly, celestial--her impressive consistency and ability to transcend genre and era with seeming ease, nothing short of divine."
Paste Magazine,Revelations,73,"While bedroom indie-rock is a beast Shamir has yet to master, it's Revelations' message of survival and optimism that sticks with you. And so one hopes Shamir finds his way, fully realizing the album's flashes of greatness."
Paste Magazine,The Kid,93,"She has put in the time to master her instrument of choice, and she combines that mastery with top-shelf compositional skills. As a result, she sounds like no one else."
Paste Magazine,Queens of the Breakers,87,"As a whole, Queens of the Breakers holds fast to hope and shows both a continuation and an evolution for one of the most creative bands out there today."
Paste Magazine,The Weather Station,84,"The only potential drawback to The Weather Station is that Lindeman's mastery of rich melodies can sometimes overshadow her narrative lyrics. Her voice becomes another vital instrumental line in the pastiche, so it takes multiple alert listens (and ideally, a lyric sheet) to fully realize the album's depth. Luckily, the album's sweet, yet confident musicality encourages repeated spins"
Paste Magazine,The Wild,87,"The Wild seems to have made good on the band's original intent. And yet, for all its unhinged energy, ragged refrains and frayed edges (Edenloff's punk-like ramble on 'Dead/Alive') it's surprisingly cohesive even in the midst of kinetic compulsion. Consider this both edgy and essential."
Paste Magazine,Turn Out the Lights,89,"An album that feels like a logical next step for the Memphis singer-songwriter, but never overreaches. And overreaching would've been easy."
Paste Magazine,Any Other Way,83,"Not every cut is a revelation, but when Shane is on, she's on."
Paste Magazine,Backwater,75,"Backwater might just reel in listeners strongly enough that they take deep dives into each and every track individually. And even then, Kllo's mystery remains intact."
Paste Magazine,Nothing Valley,93,"Cramming what should be an unworkable heap of concepts and sounds into a deliciously volatile 35 minutes, Nothing Valley is a bracing blend of scraping noise and tender melody, not unlike the recipe used by Speedy Ortiz."
Paste Magazine,A Place of Greater Safety [EP],68,"By releasing these two projects at once, it seems as if Luna are overcompensating for a lack of new fully fledged songs."
Paste Magazine,Carry Fire,78,"Although Carry Fire seemingly follows the same formula as his previous effort with the Space Shifters, 2014's Lullaby andŠ—_The Ceaseless Roar, his sound is ever-changing, experimenting with the science of otherworldly instrumentation."
Paste Magazine,Undivided Heart & Soul,81,"So while Undivided Heart & Soul explores both the past and the future of roots music, McPherson shines brightest when he blends both influences to stay rooted in the present."
Paste Magazine,Shapeshifter,72,"The sophomore record sounds like a concept album about change: changing relationships, changing surroundings, changing perspectives and changing within oneself, often without even realizing it."
Paste Magazine,Hiss Spun,89,"Somehow, she makes gothic folk, gloomy doom and grim noise feel above ground. The odds of these kinds of sounds bubbling up into the mainstream are slim, to be sure. But on Hiss Spun, Chelsea Wolfe makes it imaginable."
Paste Magazine,Colors,87,"As both a quintessential entry into his catalog and a striking entry into mainstream popular culture, Colors once again cements Beck as a clever, ever-dynamic and enduring artist."
Paste Magazine,Masseduction,87,"On MASSEDUCTION, Clark remains as unpredictable as ever, though there's one thing fans will have gotten right: so far, at least, Annie Clark has proven incapable of writing anything less than a knockout pop song."
DJ Booth,Honest,70,"Future's influence might not ever reach the same height as that famous duo's, but efforts like Honest certainly dispel his consistent-hit-man-of-little-substance status (a la T-Pain)."
DJ Booth,Mastermind,70,"The album might not be nearly good enough to launch him into any ""classic"" conversation, but it also not nearly bad enough to be viewed as a sign of his impending demise."
DJ Booth,Oxymoron,90,"While his darker material seems unchanged by fame, it's really his lighter, more radio-friendly material that gets taken to the next level on Oxymoron."
DJ Booth,Cilvia: Demo [EP],80,"A well-produced, collective backdrop is the foundation of Cilvia's creative world, but it is Rashad's poetically penned, energetically delivered raps that gently tip the scale towards a point of well-rounded balance."
DJ Booth,Lord Steppington,80,"The album's content is narrow, and while there are certainly no duds here, things do get a bit predictable as the album progresses. However, the constant non-sequiturs and familiar production doesn't take a whole lot away from the overall value of the collection."
DJ Booth,My Own Lane,60,"Influenced by what The Pharcyde did two decades ago, what Drake perfected a few years ago, and what many others have attempted since, Ink's melodic tastes and rhyming style draws from all of these influencers. The problem is, he can't quite charm like Wiz Khalifa, rhyme like Big Sean, or create art like Drake. Yet."
DJ Booth,Beyonc’©,90,"We're clearly listening to one of the most purely talented artists of our generation working at her peak, or at least somewhere close."
DJ Booth,Because the Internet,80,"The forward momentum shown on previous releases continues with Because the Internet. The jokes and gimmicks show up less often and in their place are introspective questions about himself, his relationships, and his family. Most of the time it works."
DJ Booth,Knock Madness,70,Knock Madness works best when Hopsin is either angrily fighting or humorously poking fun at some sort of ludicrosity.
DJ Booth,Sail Out [EP],60,"At its best, the California singer offers sweet but forgettable elevator music."
DJ Booth,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,80,"He's added a catchier more movie trailer-esque sound, what some call pop but I'll just call Love the Way You Lie, but really, despite the upheavals in the world, despite his relapse and recovery from drug addiction, for better or worse Eminem at 41 is essentially the same artist as Eminem at 28-years-old."
DJ Booth,My Name Is My Name,80,"The album is an amalgamation of his past trade and his current, and as is fitting for an album from a man whose past is as powdery white as a Colorado winter, it's dope."
DJ Booth,Nothing Was the Same,80,"These are the songs that don't initially blow you away, but you find yourself coming back to months later."
DJ Booth,Kiss Land,70,"Overall, Kiss Land is a decent first full-length, but for the hype that The Weeknd had built up leading to this release, some (if not most) will say that it failed to meet expectations, especially compared to the incredible hype that surrounded his 2011 debut."
DJ Booth,Hall of Fame,80,"A charismatic, agile rapper good enough to have a long and successful career, but right now a place in rap's Hall of Fame is still a stretch."
DJ Booth,Doris,60,"Lacking the dynamic between repulsive brutality and oddball humor that made Earl so uncomfortably riveting, Doris is both tonally fragmented and occasionally monotonous: an ocean of griminess broken up by earnest confessional rhymes."
DJ Booth,Something Else,90,"While it would have been easy for Tech to overpower listeners with fast rhymes and monstrous beats, on the whole Something Else is an intensely serious and sometimes even quiet album than isn't afraid to tackle issues more rappers wouldn't come near."
DJ Booth,Blurred Lines,70,"He understands what a casual, top of the iTunes chart browsing fan is looking for, and what his dedicated fans who have been there since his bluesy beginnings are looking for. Blurred Lines mostly hits its mark when aiming for these two very different audiences, but the interspersing of slimy, pop songs with smooth as butter, tasteful ones comes off as awkward."
DJ Booth,Evolution,60,"At 12 tracks long, Evolution may lack any real oomph or spectacle, but it also contains little filler, which is an achievement in today's singles dominated, bloated albums."
DJ Booth,Ciara,70,"Though at times she panders to the club a bit much, and doesn't provide quite the depth that is expected of a self-titled album and an artist on her fifth go around, Ciara is filled with a fun batch of songs."
DJ Booth,Magna Carta Holy Grail,80,"Has Jay-Z made another classic? Only time will truly tell, but my gut says MCHG will ultimately fall just short of classic status. Where does it rank among his now 15 albums? I've got it somewhere in the top third."
DJ Booth,The  Gifted,80,"The Gifted is a collection of tracks from an unarguably talented emcee, but the point at which a collection of music becomes an album, a singular work with a focus and unity strong enough to truly make an impact, Wale still hasn't reached that point.... In the meantime, we're left with a quality album."
DJ Booth,Born Sinner,90,"Overall, Born Sinner is an impressive effort."
DJ Booth,Extended Play,80,"Statik might not win the sprint, and isn't really even running the same race, but Extended Play is definitely prepared for the marathon. You could pick this album up 5-10 years from now and it would have the same power as the day it came out."
DJ Booth,Acid Rap,90,"There is no denying that with his knack for catchy melodies, descriptive songwriting, and excellent beat selection, Chance displays qualities on Acid Rap that have the potential to catapult him into superstardom. As a project itself, Acid Rap is one sweet, smooth musical journey that grapples with some serious topics in a pleasing manner."
DJ Booth,IV Play,70,IV Play finds Dream delving into more sounds and styles than ever before.
DJ Booth,Prisoner of Conscious,80,This is certainly his most sonically diverse album ever.
DJ Booth,Indicud,80,"Overall, Kid Cudi is refreshing and lively thoughout Indicud, proving he can go off and experiment (like he did on WZRD), yet come back to the Day & Night Cudi we have all grown to know and love."
DJ Booth,Wolf,80,Wolf's production features a more textured and subtle sound than we've ever heard before.
DJ Booth,Twelve Reasons to Die,90,"At a time when many of his rap peers are even more desperately changing their sound to stay relevant, Ghostface Killah is cementing his relevancy by diving even deeper into what always made him such a unique artist."
CMJ,Into the Wide,60,What results is a satisfying but somewhat uneven listening experience.
CMJ,Crush Songs,60,"On this album, it feels like she had been groping for some sense of direction after an exhaustive smackdown. And she decidedly chose the feminine end of her musical ying-yang, opting for quiet, confounding introspection."
CMJ,Goddess,70,"If there's anything missing from Goddess, it's something that could set Banks apart from the lanscape of beats + vocals that's so saturated today."
CMJ,El Pintor,80,"The new record finds singer Paul Banks and company reorganizing old reliable, post-Joy Division moves to deliver a fresher (more cheerful even?) atmospheric post-punk plate."
CMJ,Mean Love,80,"While Mean Love is his most experimental album to date, it's also his most precise."
CMJ,Picture You Staring,80,"Luckily, Picture You Staring does deliver on the promise of its lead single."
Logo,A Crow Left Of The Murder,40,There's little in the way of straightforward rock here[;] instead they have opted to renege on their commitment to flat-four crunch and embrace melodicism...and experimentalism.
Logo,Hypnotic Underworld,50,"It's all very strange yet thoroughly intriguing, but it does leave you pondering the question of what direction Ghost are planning to move in next."
CMJ,Anchor,80,Every move on the album is intentional and nothing is unchartered territory for Zammuto.
CMJ,Tied to a Star,80,This album's most striking moments often come when Mascis commits unreservedly to the ballads.
CMJ,Annabel Dream Reader,70,"The best tracks, like Burn Out The Bruise and Wire Frame Mattress, possess the lyrical degradation and sludgy rhythms of the early grunge ethos, if being tossed around with the surfing-a-graveyard sounds of L.A. antecedents from right before grunge, notably the Flesheaters and the Gun Club."
CMJ,After the End,80,"After The End is a damn good pop album, and it's not concerned with where it fits in the world."
CMJ,Brill Bruisers,80,"The songs are catchy and celebratory in every way we could hope, and what's more, this album itself is a cause for celebration."
CMJ,Lose,80,"This time around, the specifics are there. And though each isolated moment may not be immediately relatable, they create a universal portrait of our struggle with the loss of youth and the arduous task of soldiering forward while a part of us grasps for those milestones of the past."
CMJ,Bahamas Is Afie,80,"Bahamas Is Afie is an album that draws very specific parameters for itself and makes a point of staying well inside them. Bahamas never over-plays or over-shares, hence the resulting album is one that rewards repeated listens."
Logo,The Power Out,80,"It's not so much that Electrelane's signature film score sound has been replaced, more added to and built upon; becoming the veiled framework to a new - almost celebratory - level of contentment."
Logo,We Shall All Be Healed,80,"Fragmented and disturbing, yet thoroughly refreshing."
Logo,Me First,80,"It's ridiculously eclectic, yet uniformly affecting; a winter warmer that moves with a mysterious grace."
Logo,Start Something,50,"This is a perplexing album: two excellent singles, a few stellar moments of vicious riffage, but little to assuage that lingering sense of emptiness."
CMJ,Decimation Blues,60,"Decimation Blues has undeniably strong songs on the more experimental end of the spectrum and undeniably strong songs on the folky end of the spectrum. However, their placement together on one album (alongside a number of less successful songs) results in an extremely uneven listening experience."
CMJ,V,60,"Despite V's evidence of growth and energy throughout the first half of the album, excitement drains during the latter half. Kastlander's vocals are still emotionally pinpricking on each song, consistently dwelling on the subject matter of relationship/post-relationship difficulties on tracks like Full and Be Here Now. Eventually though, just like hearing a friend complain about their ex for three months straight after the split, it gets tiresome."
CMJ,Lights Out,50,"While the songs on Lights Out would certainly suit a fine live atmosphere, their simplicity, repetition and generic nature create a rather weak album that fails to hold its own in today's complicated indie rock landscape."
CMJ,Experiments in Time,80,"There's no attempt to make any songs appropriate for looped listens or party playlists, and yet it's precisely because of this that Experiments In Time sounds like it could've only come from Willis Earl Beal, and Willis Earl Beal alone."
CMJ,LP1,80,"LP1 takes the humid isolation of Twigs' EP1 and EP2 and twists it into ten tracks of relationship Hail Marys. But there's a subdued sense of strength running under Barnett's pleas that translates into a dark confidence, and in that tension is where LP1 finds its best moments."
CMJ,Sand+Silence,80,"Rosebuds have a smooth, beyond approachable, ear-massaging loveliness, this time honed with a production clarity of near Steely Dan-like proportions, if on an indie level. Instrumentation remains fairly minimal, delicately played and mixed to perfection."
CMJ,Wild Onion,70,"This doesn't feel like yet more easy-trash, pool party punk (though it is that, and good at it), but something that has a preternatural songwriting zing and energy not predicated on just the fumbling charm of a stained '80s metal t-shirt and Ronettes knowledge, but actual, like charm."
Logo,Obrigado Saudade,70,"Pierce consistently avoids the disturbance of breakbeats and jump cuts, instead rolling the elements into a smooth melange of sound that references world, dance and folk music, yet transcends all."
Logo,Apropa't,70,"Here their ambient electro is enhanced with a melange of influences that include soul, jazz and - a real winner this - Brazilian psychedelia."
Logo,Talkie Walkie,90,"This is evocative music. It's beatific, charming, sophisticated and cool."
Logo,Kamikaze,80,"There's plenty of impressive tongue-twisting here, but as the re-working of 'Feel So Good' illustrates, he's even more impressive when he slips down a gear to work the ladies."
Logo,Margerine Eclipse,80,"The band's most accessible, blithe pop record to date."
CMJ,They Want My Soul,70,"A solid road map of new found diversity and eclecticism is laid out throughout a large chunk of They Want My Soul, and despite the inevitable growing pains, Spoon really does seem poised to continue rising from the ashes of their near disappearance."
CMJ,Gist Is,80,"It's good right away, but it doesn't make sense until later. Gist Is might take patience, but it pays off."
CMJ,Lese Majesty,80,"Lese Majesty is a seriously weird album, but it succeeds in calling the genre's current established order to question and challenging what it means for something to be considered a hip hop record, all while remaining sonically pleasing enough to keep the listener engaged with the ambitious message that Shabazz Palaces is adamant at getting across."
CMJ,The Voyager,80,"While each song on the album seems to tell a different story, together they tell one: Some things may have changed in that six-year interim, but those changes have only worked in Lewis's favor."
CMJ,These Days...,60,"Ab-Soul puts out a solid release here, helped along by some big name features and big performances from his TDE labelmates, but at times These Days feels too generic or just flat out stale, ultimately failing to carry the Black Hippy torch in the ways that good kid m.A.A.d city and Oxymoron did for the crew."
CMJ,For Those Who Stay,80,"This is a strong indie rock release that further establishes PS I Love You's sound, improving upon it but not really do much to shift it. Maybe that's a good thing though, because this album is a great listen."
CMJ,Alvvays,60,"Overall though, there's more comfort than debauchery on Alvvays."
Logo,Secret Wars,70,"'Secret Wars' is an engaging 40 minutes; a haphazard, likely to spontaneously combust at any moment 40 minutes to be sure, but that was the ethic that spawned rock 'n' roll in the first place and in these hands there's plenty of life in it yet."
Logo,Punk Rock,80,Shows that Jon Langford's voice has lost bite but gained growl.
Logo,Leave Your Name,80,Often you're left amazed at the fact that this is the work of just one man.
Logo,Immortal Memory,70,What does surprise is the way the results combine Clannad with Cocteau Twins.
Logo,Tasty,70,"'Tasty', though haunted by more than a few sops to the slick-soul zeitgeist, is an impressive return."
Logo,Atlas,90,"Something new has been born here; its parents are every form of dance and many forms of rock, and it rolls."
CMJ,Conversations,70,"Conversations is an album that will sink you into some kind of woozy hypnotic stupor, not pull you out of one."
CMJ,Jungle,60,"It's equally as innovative as it is mundane, equally as ambitious as it is safe, and equally as fun as it is tedious. Well, the last one isn't quite true, this album is a ton of fun."
CMJ,Passerby,80,"Their tactics may be minimalist, and their sound may at first feel archaic, but sometimes pure ingenuity is all musicians really need to be noticed."
Logo,Maryland Mansions,70,"Kidwell has distilled hip-hop into a brew that also contains trace elements of Nine Inch Nails, neo-goth noir and the finest Bristolian trip-hop, as well as the ever-present sonic manipulations that result from a very big iPod and a brain to match."
Logo,Afterglow,80,"It's gorgeous, moving and magnificent."
Logo,Everything To Everyone,60,A confusing listen.
Logo,Logic Will Break Your Heart,70,"Disco, punk and pop, all in one bag."
Logo,A People's History Of The Dismemberment Plan,60,"Unfortunately, many of these mixes were submitted either by talented fans or lesser known professionals, and often they've removed much more than they've put in."
Logo,The Ladybug Transistor,20,"Horrid, mannered late Sixties-styled easy-listening wank."
Logo,Ima Robot,70,"Off-kilter, irreverent and unbelievably addictive."
Logo,Shine A Light,80,"There's no shortage of pogo anthems, reflective quiet and headspinning ideology, and never a dull moment."
Logo,I Am The Fun Blame Monster,80,"It will take at least ten listens before you hear everything that's going on, and ten more to understand it, yet this is far from impenetrable; it boasts a melody line that any pop princess would sell her plastic soul for, and prompts the idea that Knopf and his cohorts have been hanging around a crossroads doing just the same."
Logo,band red,90,"A taste for the exotic and a winning way with a winnowing hook leavens the most ear-shredding aural barrage, short-circuiting a connection between central nervous system and booty."
Logo,Summer Of The Shark,70,It sounds like he's cherry-picked his record collection in an attempt to allow the listener a glimpse into his restless mind.
The Quietus,Rest,80,Rest is still the most French record you're likely to hear all century.
The Quietus,If All I Was Was Black,80,One of the great successes of If All I Was is that it has the same levity as the anthems of the civil rights era.
The Quietus,Savage Young D’_ [Box Set],80,"Like most bumper collections of this nature, Savage Young D’_ is not a starting point. Sensibly, one should swot up on H’_sker D’_'s complete 1984-86 output first, then dig into this box and its wealth of eyewitness anecdotes and photos of puppy-fattened band members. Historical context suitably delivered, toast the lifespan of a great rock band and burn one for the guy who didn't see this release hit the shelves."
The Quietus,Wizard Bloody Wizard,80,"Wizard Bloody Wizard still rocks hard enough to justify the occasional rebellious upward glance from the existential trudge down the long spiral into nothingness that they evoke so bleakly, and so well."
The Quietus,To Syria with Love,80,"Some listeners are bound to find this repetitive too, and nowhere near different enough from his previous work. Yet To Syria, With Love is also Souleyman's heaviest and hardest record since Leh Jani back in 2011."
The Quietus,The Kid,70,"There are moments in The Kid where Smith's ability to meld the electronic and the organic into a symbiotic web of sound and music is comforting and soothing, the harshness of modern noise and atonality sublimated into something that provides a balming comfort."
The Quietus,Ken,80,"While Poison Season sounded like the kind of late-career 'mature' album that Bejar could be content to make for the rest of his life, ken shows that he is still full of the potential to surprise--and long may he continue to do so."
The Quietus,Plunge,80,"It might be less daring than some of the other hankerings, but there's no room for emotional snobbery on Plunge, no victory that's not worth celebrating: those seized, stolen intimacies she's grubbed around for, the flashes of desire and flushes of pleasure, are things to be savoured."
The Quietus,Mnestic Pressure,80,"As a work that gathers up so much of what's going on in modern dance and electronic music in 2017 and finds ways to make them click together, Mnestic Pressure feels like a game-changer, or at the very least a defining moment. Time will tell."
The Quietus,Musik,70,"Eggleston cycles through separate fugue-like riffs, filling in transitions with electronic crescendos that lend the piece a cinematic energy."
The Quietus,"A  Flame My Love, a Frequency",70,"A flame my love, a frequency is a modest, introspective album. It focuses on the small, the minute, turning inwards in the face of questions too large to grasp."
The Quietus,Love What Survives,80,"Love What Survives, with its seductive beats and incredible production, is a strong record that finally cuts Mount Kimbie's ties with 'post-dubstep'. If they can avoid falling into routine, their post-post-dubstep future looks exciting."
The Quietus,Masseduction,90,"MASSEDUCTION defies expectation, defies definition and defies the very idea that definition can exist. It's an album detailing the mess of identity politics and power structures, and yet it hits serious cohesive highs. There is no cookie-cutter remedy, no rallying cry, just a baker's dozen viewpoints of the chasm where we once thought order, power, and meaning lived."
The Quietus,Aromanticism,80,"Aromanticism is an exquisitely well-crafted piece of work, which retains a delicate complexity despite its minimalism."
The Quietus,Sterilize,80,"Despite the fact that listening to one of their albums in full feels like a 40-minute bludgeoning, there's something oddly heart-warming at play here. Unsane are not chameleons or shapeshifters but rather stoic veterans unashamed to continue honing a sound many would argue they perfected decades ago."
The Quietus,1992-2001,90,"The remastering job here is superb and the nine previously unheard tracks are an joy to discover--1992-2001 is nigh-on perfect as an introduction to one of pop's best ever kept secrets. Unlock it and wander all year long, then seek out what full-lengths you can find. In Acetone, you've got yourself a lifelong companion."
The Quietus,Plum,80,"Wand are a special band, and the new emotional range suits them."
The Quietus,Okovi,80,"While it's a release that might disengage fans of her more sub-rosa earlier material of yore, Zola Jesus has evolved into an artist where pop--born from a need to mend from trauma or otherwise--is no longer a recurrent secondary descriptor, but a primary one. Danilova has loosened the shackles that have made this remarkable metamorphosis possible."
The Quietus,1992 Deluxe,70,"1992 Deluxe is a powerful starting point from which the 'New York aficionado' can further hone and refine her sound. For longtime Princess Nokia fans, is is also the climax of a five-year crescendo and satisfying evidence that she has retained her powerful sense of self."
The Quietus,Hiss Spun,60,For the most part Hiss Spun comprises what can be succinctly described as downtempo dirges with a handful of diversions. ... Whether this reliance on slow burners is a good thing will largely depend on your appetite for diversity. Arguably the weakest aspect of Hiss Spun is the hit-and-miss nature of its ability to land blows to your gut--a goal which tends to be fundamental to music of this stripe.
The Quietus,Multi-Task,70,"Multi-Task doesn't rock the boat too much; if anything it is more streamlined, less abrasive, ready to be swallowed whole."
The Quietus,Music for the Age of Miracles,80,"This album, more than any punk tune, is the sound of the suburbs; rather than being from the suburbs, it sounds like the suburbs. If you think that's no recommendation, just hear it. There is beauty here, and sadness, and peril, and deep, deep soul."
The Quietus,Thrice Woven,60,"The second half of the album lacks the spirit of its first two transcendent tracks. ... But, for those first 19 glorious minutes, Thrice Woven skirts the eye of the storm, flitting between untrammelled power and celestial beauty with a finesse that few can match."
The Quietus,The Gradual Progression,70,"With The Gradual Progression, one definitely gets the sense that Fox is making an unselfconscious attempt to forge forward with music, an unabashed statement for progression. Though it's not entirely successful, one has to admire this kind of ambition. He's made an album that's hard to describe in both generic and theoretical terms."
The Quietus,Savage (Songs from a Broken World),80,"Numan's appropriation of Arabic musical patterns, textures and instruments can make for mildly uncomfortable listening at first, but on repeated plays these are the moments that really stand out. His decision to directly incorporate these less familiar (to the western ear) musical mores into his already alien-sounding style pays off."
The Quietus,Remember Terry,80,Remember Terry is deliriously memorable. Most albums of this ilk from the Australian underground will have a couple of standout tracks; this album is full of them.
The Quietus,Mellow Waves,60,"Cornelius's mastery of the mix is still evident, but the album as a whole comes strangely across as a throwback to former glories rather than an expansion of an idiosyncratic universe."
The Quietus,Before the Applause,80,"This time with an added bite of something that is entirely their own. This is a remarkable album, and easily good enough to send them global."
The Quietus,Electric Trim,80,"Self-assured and comfortable in his skin, Lee Ranaldo is properly striking out on his own and sounding all the better for it."
The Quietus,Exile in the Outer Ring,80,"Musically, this is Anderson at her most assured: she has synthesised her various musical interests and influences--noise music, metal, grunge, folk and country--into an entirely idiosyncratic musical lexicon."
The A.V. Club,The Saga Continues,67,"It's low-stakes stuff, but if you're enough of a Wu fan to read this far, you'll be happy the saga continues--at least for now."
The A.V. Club,Going Grey,91,"The Front Bottoms are more confident, and secure enough to confess to all they don't yet know. It's a privilege to listen in as they work it out."
The A.V. Club,Lotta Sea Lice,75,"It's a lovefest in the best way, and a worthy addition to both of their catalogs."
The A.V. Club,The Ooz,67,"All that aimlessness is certainly on brand for the hazy expanses Marshall so clearly wants to create, but like the seeping unctuousness for which the album is named, it threatens to engulf his more potent songs."
The A.V. Club,Nothing Valley,83,"With an infectious energy that shines through even the most plodding beats, the debut LP from Chicago's Melkbelly is the kind of inspired noise-pop that similarly conquers 100 sound-alikes to lodge itself in the brain."
The A.V. Club,Ogilala,58,"No matter what he does to it, that voice is still unmistakably Billy, and while Ogilala gives it some genuine moments of quietly affecting beauty, after 11 beatless tracks laden with burdensome titles ('Amarinthe,' 'Antietam,' 'Shiloh,' 'Half-Life Of An Autodidact'), yet light on memorable melodies or any lyrics that match the frankness of the setting, by album's end, you long to hear it over a wall of guitars again."
The A.V. Club,Masseduction,100,"It's the best encapsulation of her vision to date, here fully under her control."
The A.V. Club,Colors,75,"Colors is solid--Beck doesn't make bad records, whatever mode he's in--and it flirts with greatness, but he's at his best when he decides to either get loose or get serious, less so when he drives straight down the"
The A.V. Club,Offering,67,"Offering's second half becomes a stoned and fuzzy blur, its overall high settling into a pleasurable yet indistinct haze."
The A.V. Club,Take Me Apart,75,"There's another EP in here that's every bit as good as Hallucinogen, but as an album, Take Me Apart remains more proof of Kelela's talent and still-unrealized potential."
The A.V. Club,The Kid,100,"The Kid is truly an album to experience beginning to end, one with a knack for making you feel--as Smith sings on 'An Intention'--'everything at the same time.'"
The A.V. Club,The Weather Station,75,"There's plenty to unpack lyrically, too, which makes it ideal for a headphones listen. You know, not unlike Blue or Court And Spark."
The A.V. Club,As You Were,83,"For his first solo album, Liam Gallagher goes a long way toward establishing himself apart from brother Noel and the rest of Oasis. His most successful tracks here evoke Nashville rather than Manchester."
The A.V. Club,Cry Cry Cry,91,"Cry Cry Cry is Wolf Parade's most vibrant, energetic record to date."
The A.V. Club,The Desaturating Seven,75,"It gets its message across in surprisingly approachable prog-funk hooks, the kind that might convince even lapsed fans and skeptics to give them a second chance."
The A.V. Club,Younger Now,58,"Cyrus' voice has scarcely been more expressive, and there's no question that she means what she sings. That said, you might long for a more inspired metaphor (or eight)."
The A.V. Club,Visions of a Life,83,"In lesser hands, this kind of sonic disparity could be chaotic and confusing--but with Rowsell's voice as the guiding light, Visions is a captivating, enjoyable ride."
The A.V. Club,Relatives in Descent,83,"It's devastating music uniquely attuned to our current cultural moment, stridently political but less interested in dictating the problems or their solutions than in mapping the emotional topography of being alive and terrified in 2017."
The A.V. Club,Stranger in the Alps,100,"Stranger In The Alps alchemizes sorrow into redemptive beauty. It's never about wallowing, but about slowly moving through it. That difference, played out over some incredible, wise-beyond-her-years songwriting, makes it one of the best albums of the year."
The A.V. Club,Three Futures,91,"There aren't many hooks to be found here, which means a lot of Three Futures sort of blurs together. But it's all hazily fascinating, flowing naturally through its various peaks and valleys, and it succeeds in Scott's goal of being truly immersive listening--something that reveals itself to you in strange new ways each time you return."
The A.V. Club,Gemini,50,"This is the same old Macklemore, stuffing all of his songs with drop-out catchphrases and horn solos and minutes-long American Idol-style belting, all starry-eyed and corny in the same way that, say, the music in a Broadway musical is."
The A.V. Club,V,100,"Overall, V maintains a distinctively elegant gloom, The Horrors continuing to find intoxicating new shades within their gray moods. It's an album that confirms them as one of the most consistently surprising, most artistically sophisticated, simply greatest rock bands working today."
The A.V. Club,A Sentimental Education,75,"It doesn't hurt that every song given the Luna treatment--mellow, reverb-y guitars, Dean Wareham's winning deadpan vocals--pretty much becomes a Luna song."
The A.V. Club,Wonderful Wonderful,58,"That lack of any real direction or purpose colors all of Wonderful Wonderful, a record that, even by The Killers' standards, boasts little depth beneath its glossy surface."
The A.V. Club,Hiss Spun,58,"Hiss Spun is a full-on sludge-metal extravaganza, never content to go slow and heavy when it could be going slower and heavier. The bombast is overwhelming, and while there's an admirable zeal to her drive for making almost every second as intense as possible, it begins to get numbing."
The A.V. Club,Luciferian Towers,83,"The band still builds giant sonic structures with guitars, drums, and violins, stretching out into song suites that can last for 15 minutes or more."
The A.V. Club,Thrice Woven,75,"Not since acclaimed debut Diadem Of 12 Stars has Wolves In The Throne Room rocked this hard and steady; in its sustained racket, it approximates one of the band's live shows, which tend to be all blistering blitzkrieg all the time, drone passages withheld."
The A.V. Club,Hallelujah Anyhow,83,"Unsurprisingly, the stellar Hallelujah Anyhow often feels like a restless fever dream."
The A.V. Club,Strange Peace,83,"Metz could fall into the trap of making the same album over and over, but Strange Peace shows the band taking steps to subtly expand its sound. The attack remains, but it's not as relentless."
The A.V. Club,Concrete and Gold,83,"On their ninth album, Concrete And Gold, Foo Fighters go all in on that classic rock love, resulting in a batch of songs that uses the past to give the band new life."
Rock Sound,Technology,90,"Clocking in at just under an hour across 14 songs, about 12 of which could easily be singles, Technology is engaging, fun and an early contender for album of the year, plus the album of this band's career."
E! Online,Christ Illusion,75,"They're not exactly shaking up their own heavy-duty formula, but with the hell-and-handbasket thing going strong, what difference does it make to them?"
E! Online,Year Of The Dog... Again,42,"If he keeps going like this, it's a good bet that his best days are behind him."
Rock Sound,Knowing What You Know Now,80,This long-awaited second album isn't just thrilling from start to finish: it might also be exactly what rock needs right now.
Rock Sound,Mania,80,"This is brave, baffling, bonkers and most importantly, absolutely brilliant. Strap yourselves in, it's a hell of a ride."
Rock Sound,Hold On To Your Heart,80,"It works. It all makes an album full of awesome, genuine pop-rock music. Time will tell if this album and the next couple of years propel this band to the huge rooms these songs were made for, but for now? A great band just got even better."
Rock Sound,Underworld,70,"Despite its more slippery moments, Underworld finds Tonight Alive honing in on and owning their identity again; and given the bigger picture, taking a huge step in the right direction."
Rock Sound,Vale,70,"There are strings, spoken word sections and sweeping solos, so while the themes and melodies may sound familiar, the overall tapestry rarely wears thin."
Rock Sound,American Fall,70,"While they continue down a more measured, accessible route--calling to mind everyone from The Clash to Rancid--there's a freshness to the anarchy this time. Here's a welcome beacon of hope."
Punknews.org (Staff),Everything Now,30,Everything Now feels like everything's dead as it lacks any sort of freshness or intrigue.
E! Online,In My Mind,50,"There's nothing as instantly likable as ""Frontin',"" and even with the presence of some bigwig collaborators the disc sounds strangely inspiration-free."
E! Online,Highway Companion,67,"The album's bluesy Americana-inspired tunes like ""Saving Grace"" and ""Turn This Car Around"" are, sure, kind of predictable, but they make up for that by being pretty darn good songs."
E! Online,One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This,91,Let's hope we don't have to wait until 2040 for something else this good.
E! Online,Another Fine Day,83,"For a bunch of jokesters, these guys deliver some seriously good music."
Rock Sound,The Dusk in Us,80,"Gut-busting, heart-wrenching and captivating from vicious beginning to devastating conclusion, the likes of 'Cannibals', the jolting 'Arkhipov Calm' and beautifully excruciating title track capture the band at their most ambitious and dominant."
Rock Sound,Shapeshifter,90,"Front to back, start to finish, this is pop-punk for those who have lived, loved and lost and aren't afraid to contemplate the fact that maybe, just maybe, it isn't going to be their weekend or their year."
Rock Sound,Phantom Anthem,70,"Phantom Anthem is an awful lot to stomach in one sitting, but those prepared to strap in and take the ride from guttural beginnings to dramatic conclusion will be rewarded with an album of intense grandeur and unmatchable ambition."
Rock Sound,As You Please,80,"It all combines to make Citizen's gloomiest, most atmospheric record yet--and also one of the most disturbing of the year so far. It's a memorable journey."
Rock Sound,Gossip,80,"It's impossible not to admire the scale and ambition of what Sleeping With Sirens are trying to achieve here, so don't be too surprised if they're swapping Warped Tour for arenas before too long."
Punknews.org (Staff),Out in the Storm,80,"It's tough to get through in terms of lyrics, but musically Waxahatchee deliver yet another piece of art."
Punknews.org (Staff),Our Pleasure,80,"Overall, Our Pleasure feels musically intricate on a new level--thicker basslines, much more pronounced drums and priding itself with a lot of guitar-driven character. It's them at their most distinct and honestly, most assertively powerful stance."
Punknews.org (Staff),Need to Feel Your Love,80,"An endearing work of art from a band that undoubtedly have more magic up their sleeve, as they've consistently shown in the past. And as this album shows, they have a lot of love to share, and for us to feel."
Punknews.org (Staff),Dead Reflection,70,"Shane Told's lyrics cut deep as usual but his vocals have too many treatments applied to it here and come off over-produced. If you're looking for vintage Silverstein though, ""Mirror Box"" has you covered. It gets a bit too poppy later on with ""Cut and Run"" and ""The Afterglow"" but by that time you know what you got yourself into. A nostalgic trip that should be enjoyed for what it is--a look back at the salad days."
E! Online,Black Holes & Revelations,100,"Head-smashing songs like ""Supermassive Black Hole"" and ""Invincible"" all point to an album that strives to be nothing less than epic. It succeeds."
E! Online,Impeach My Bush,67,"And by classics we mean poorly produced electro songs you'll hear once, chuckle and never want to hear again--unless you have a head wound or a Sparks fetish."
E! Online,The Avalanche: Outtakes & Extras From The Illinois Album,100,"Most of these songs are just as good, if not better, than the ones that actually made the cut."
E! Online,The Eraser,67,"This could have been groundbreaking once upon a time, but there's nothing really new here and only a few songs ever rise above sheer novelty value."
E! Online,The Silver Lining,75,The group sounds genuinely reinvigorated.
Rock Sound,"All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell",80,"All 10 tracks here bear such scars, adding up to a staggering work of honesty, beauty and artistic achievement. It's hugely impressive on those terms alone... but even more so given everything PVRIS endured in its creation."
Rock Sound,Our Pleasure,70,"Drew's definitely been reunited with his fury again, and it feels so good."
Rock Sound,A Black Mile to the Surface,80,"Full of textured, wide-screen soundscapes, the record dips its feet in electronic waters, yet retains the emotional vulnerability that has always defined the Atlanta band. There's an extra dose of sinister unease, too, especially on 'Lead, SD' and 'The Moth'."
Rock Sound,The Knife,70,"From the barbed, Blink-182-esque pop-punk of 'A Million Miles' and grouchy, tongue in cheek call-outs of 'Am I Deaf' to sun-drenched ska numbers like 'Don't Let Me Go', this is a mix of music for lounging by a pool, and tearing up a sweaty basement venue."
Punknews.org (Staff),"Howling, For the Nightmare Shall Consume",90,"The band, here, is confident enough, skilled enough, and thoughtful enough to turn this massive piece--two lps of dark-metaphysical music backed by hardcore-tinged thrash--into one of their best works, if not their best work."
Punknews.org (Staff),Melodrama,80,"There are no gimmicks. There's nothing screaming for acceptance. Melodrama is a raw, real album under its sparkly clean production. One written for the masses but able to resonate with each individual listener."
Punknews.org (Staff),You're Welcome,60,"Right now they still seem to be in the reactionary phase, rebelling against the slick pop punk produced for Warner Bros. Ideally they'll find a happy medium but for now we have You're Welcome."
Punknews.org (Staff),Black Laden Crown,70,"The fact is, on Black Laden Crown, Danzig seems to have reached the conceptual and sonic epiphany he's been searching for since the end of Danzig 4. The production issues may dampen this epiphany to a degree, but a production problem in of itself is not enough to buckle the dark message behind the computerized choices."
Punknews.org (Staff),Spin,70,"Tigers Jaw have evolved but they're not going to drastically turn the corner. It's more of a slow bend around a hill. spin acknowledges the past, tipping its hat at it but that nod is an honest goodbye signaling a move to newer pastures."
Punknews.org (Staff),No Resolution,70,"This is what angst sounds like when it ages gracefully, and this album is definitely worth a listen."
E! Online,American V: A Hundred Highways,67,This set of songs comes with a chill of morbidity that's hard to shake.
E! Online,Fundamental,100,Fundamental is the group's most inspired album in nearly a decade.
E! Online,Loose,67,She mysteriously trims away her individuality and morphs into a J.Lo imitator.
E! Online,Under The Iron Sea,67,"Even if Keane hasn't completely gone down with Under The Iron Sea, the band is merely treading water here."
E! Online,Corinne Bailey Rae,50,"Weighed down with bland lyrics and blander arrangements, it meanders off into chick-rock clich’©s and lazy easy-listening melodies."
Rock Sound,Dead Reflection,70,"It's very much the work of a band who are still capable of delivering the goods even after 17 years, while showing the fresh-faced up and comers a thing or two."
Rock Sound,Gravebloom,60,"It doesn't deviate much from the well-worn blueprint that the band have stuck to throughout their career, but when your music is this deliciously punishing why would you change?"
Rock Sound,Hydrograd,60,"The frontman sounds great as ever, as on the powerful 'Fabuless' and 'The Witness Trees', but his usual conviction isn't as present and the album feels largely colourless."
Rock Sound,The Beautiful Stories,70,"At just seven tracks The Beautiful Stories is a touch slight, but whether it's the '80s guitar tones or quiet insistence of the quintet's lyrics, it'll leave a much longer impression."
Rock Sound,Living Arrangements,70,"This is his new project and, unsurprisingly, it's brilliant."
Rock Sound,Precious Art,70,"Lyrics largely consist of nostalgic references, in-jokes and arch observations, but with a bummed-out charm that invites rather than excludes. If you've played the classics to death and want a fresh fix, this is among the best of the new breed's offerings."
Punknews.org (Staff),DREAMCAR,60,"Apart from running repetitive with no real memorable tracks in the back-end, it's the cheese factor that ends up hampering the show."
Punknews.org (Staff),Slowdive,80,"If you're looking for something that's as moody as it is calming, and as beautiful as it is atmospheric, Slowdive's for you. Just thank the heavens they came back to save us with these eight tracks."
Punknews.org (Staff),Make the Best of It,60,"This album continues to keep the Have Mercy brand stagnant and disappointingly makes surpassing their debut a tall order. ""Smoke and Lace"" and ""Coexist"" are probably the only songs that recapture the magic of the first record. Everything else tries too hard to repeat the slow/loud dynamic they pride themselves on."
Punknews.org (Staff),DAMN.,90,"DAMN. isn't the same kind of masterpiece that To Pimp a Butterfly is, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless."
Punknews.org (Staff),inŠ—¢ter aŠ—¢liŠ—¢a,70,"If I hadn't heard ROC, this album would have probably gotten a half-star more, but as it stands it's just above decent."
Punknews.org (Staff),The Walls Will Fall [EP],70,"Terror offers few surprises, but has delivered another solid slab of hardcore."
E! Online,The Big Bang,91,[It] shows things are as loony as ever in Busta's camp.
E! Online,Rather Ripped,67,"[It] feels more overly familiar and Velvet Underground-y than usual, which isn't a good thing for a band with such forward-thinking ideals."
E! Online,Begin To Hope,83,"Her vocal quirks can take some getting used to, but the oblique melodies and cosmic lyrics in songs such as ""On the Radio"" and ""20 Years of Snow"" demonstrate what a remarkable talent is mixed in with all the idiosyncrasies."
E! Online,Decemberunderground,75,"By mimicking the sound of every Hot Topic band crashing into one--with songs that pilfer from the Killers, My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy--we have to wonder if they haven't just orchestrated their own extinction."
E! Online,Be Your Own Pet,100,"A blur of shouted vocals, tribal drums and scattershot riffs."
Rock Sound,Two Parts Viper,70,"An album that will creep up on you time and time again, Two Parts Viper is more evidence that all you need to incite a riot is a guitar, drums and pure attitude."
Rock Sound,Last Young Renegade,80,"Its delicate, sparse build-and-explode approach is largely typical of what Last Young Renegade has to offer--anthemic yet atmospheric songs that are subtly affecting."
Rock Sound,Wolves,70,"One of punk's few great constants, the Chicago four-piece are back and as furious as ever with this eighth album. As you'd expect, they don't fumble the ball."
Rock Sound,One More Light,60,"Sure, the relative absence of co-frontman Mike Shinoda saps some of the band's unique character and they get bogged down in sluggish, downcast dirges in the final stretch, but there's also a sense of liberation running through these 10 tracks; the mark of artists unshackled from their past, stepping into the unknown."
Rock Sound,DREAMCAR,80,"Bearing the smart but dark pop hallmarks of bands like The Cure and Echo And The Bunnymen, it's astonishing how the L.A. foursome's fusion of disco, funk and hot gothic takes sounds so fresh in 2017, 30-odd years after that stuff's heyday."
Rock Sound,Make the Best of It,60,There are enough special moments and poignant observations here to recommend a peek into the gloom.
Rock Sound,Graveyard Shift,70,There are plenty of moments on this record where it feels like Motionless have grown into their own skin; tugging at the heartstrings one moment and cutting straight to the bone the next.
Punknews.org (Staff),Makes Me Sick,40,The lyrics are cheesy and uninspiring at best.
Punknews.org (Staff),Swear I'm Good at This,60,"Much like peer Frankie Cosmos, the sugarcoated uneasiness works, especially when done well. Swear I'm Good At This is a solid debut."
Punknews.org (Staff),Coming Home,30,"Coming Home scrubs away the band's aggression and tries to get more emotional, but all it does is end up sounding like that perv you'd never leave a drunk friend around."
Punknews.org (Staff),Bloodlust,60,It's a solid listen in its own right.
Punknews.org (Staff),Emperor of Sand,70,"Working again with producer Brendan O'Brien, Mastodon maintains their polished technical expertise. The album is clean but not scrubbed of feeling."
Punknews.org (Staff),Fail You Again,80,"This time, they're much more versed and diversified, expanding their borders in terms of storytelling as well. Chris Loporto's vocals drive the record home, especially on slow melodic burns like ""Quitting"" and ""Molly's Desk"", which all pop with a loud bang at the end, signifying what Can't Swim are about."
E! Online,The River In Reverse,75,"An urgent, soulful collection."
E! Online,A Lively Mind,50,"Employing actress Brittany Murphy on the ridiculous ""Faster Kill Pussycat"" hardly helps, as does reducing Pharrell Williams' talent with a caricature of a tune like ""Sex 'N' Money."""
E! Online,The Garden,83,"Edgier and more experimental than its predecessors, The Garden also ramps up the chill factor."
E! Online,We Don't Need To Whisper,67,"Listening to all this Edge-y guitar doodling and whiny wailing, the question remains: Why mess with a fun, 20-million-album-selling formula for this ponderous prog project?"
E! Online,Taking The Long Way,75,The Texas trio sounds like a new group.
E! Online,"Stand Still, Look Pretty",50,A thoroughly dull collection of acoustic-based country-rock ballads you could hear at any local open-mike night.
E! Online,So Amazin',67,"Unfortunately, she has also followed Ms. Knowles' lead in recording overly earnest, confessional ballads."
Rock Sound,The Walls Will Fall [EP],70,"From the breakneck belligerence of 'Balance The Odds' to the nostalgic groove of 'Step To You', this is the purest strain of hardcore you could possibly mosh your life away to."
Punknews.org (Staff),Voids,30,Most of the album is way over-polished and creatively stifled. MTB try to maintain a sense of how well they did prog-punk but this is a line they can't even straddle anymore. The beauty that was once there is gone. Voids is aptly titled.
Punknews.org (Staff),You're Not As _____ As You Think,80,These are the songs that cut deep and cut slowly.
Punknews.org (Staff),The Grinding Wheel,80,"It's on par with recent great stuff by Testament, Exodus or Death Angel. It's another excellent addition to the already impressive Overkill discography."
Punknews.org (Staff),The Universe and Me,80,"While it's unlikely to have the same influence as his earlier work in Guided by Voices, this is an album that is likely to get repeated spins on the turntable. It also is a solid reminder, that Tobin Sprout is every bit the songwriter and musician that his former GBV cohort Rob Pollard is."
Punknews.org (Staff),Moh Lhean,70,WHY? remains an ever-changing experiment. Moh Lhean pays off for the patient listener.
Punknews.org (Staff),Why Love Now,70,"As a whole, Pissed Jeans have put out the best, harshest, yet most listenable album of their career."
E! Online,Broken Boy Soldiers,83,Sounds like they had as much fun making it as you're going to have listening to it.
E! Online,Every Man For Himself,67,Hoobastank balances heavy riffs with dark existentialism and hooks that closely imitate that of its breakthrough hit.
Pitchfork,Culture II,64,"It's still a joy to hear the Migos rap, which is why it's especially depressing that Culture II ultimately feels like a drag--a formless grab bag compiled without much care."
Pitchfork,Laughing At The System [EP],80,Total Control make an EP of curveballs sound puzzlingly coherent thanks in no small part to their fine craftsmanship.
Punknews.org (Staff),Nightmare Logic,80,"Ultimately, they're doing retro-thrash with a modern feel, and they're pretty damn good at it. If you like to bang your head, Power Trip should be on your radar."
Pitchfork,The Worm's Heart,66,It's a pleasant oddity in the Shins' catalogueŠ—”neither a dazzling reinvention of the original release (see: Massive Attack V Mad Professor's towering No Protection) nor a hastily-assembled insult to the band's creative work .
Pitchfork,Could It Be Different?,68,"Perhaps they figured dark times call for bright music, but this overly polished record often feels like a missed opportunity."
Pitchfork,Snares Like a Haircut,80,"No Age's name seems self-actualizing. And in their psycho-candied sound, which has progressively gotten better, they still know how to locate the timeless, fever-pitched feeling of a beginning."
Pitchfork,Vessel of Love,74,"By the end of Vessel of Love, it is apparent that an interest in reggae is far from the only thing Cook learned from Ari Up, or the most important thing. She learned to find her voice and make it heard."
Pitchfork,Down Below,80,"This is a band that absolutely revels in the possibilities suggested by its obsidian thrills, no matter the potential changes in the audience's size and scope. Down Below is about death and hell, sure, but it's proudly, defiantly not meant for an underground anymore."
Pitchfork,The Time Is Now,55,"For an album called The Time Is Now, David spends too much of his time looking like he's trying to catch up."
Pitchfork,Freedom's Goblin,81,"Freedom's Goblin is ultimately a celebration of Segall's aesthetic and emotional freedom--a definitive capstone to the first decade of a scuzzy, heartfelt songwriter nonpareil."
Pitchfork,The Thread That Keeps Us,71,"Calexico have made records that sound like this one before, but they've never made one with quite this much fight in it."
Pitchfork,Marble Skies,69,"While Marble Skies doesn't always quite get there, the planets it frantically orbits while awaiting touchdown are worth the journey."
Pitchfork,All Melody,78,"Across 12 songs and 74 minutes, All Melody functions as a single, cohesive piece of music, with recurring themes interwoven throughout. It's easy to get lost in the album and then, hearing a familiar motif, come up short, as if turning a corner in a long hallway and wondering if you hadn't passed the same spot just a moment ago. It's a pleasantly disorienting sensation."
Pitchfork,2 Tha Left,77,"There isn't a moment where Perico is upstaged, and his immediate charm is in the stylish near yelp of his rapping voice, the way he struts over a beat. He seems to always be at the top of his register, but he tucks a deceptive range of perky melody into each verse and hook. All of this plays out over a sleek G-funk backdrop, with plenty of playful nuance in the production."
Pitchfork,"Vision Songs, Vol. 1 [Reissue]",67,"There are brief glints of enlightenment to be heard here, but more often than not, Laraaji's makeshift songs come across like daily affirmations as heard in a hotel lounge."
Pitchfork,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,62,"It's frequently a difficult listen, and not for the reasons Garbus intended."
Pitchfork,Blue Madonna,57,"Blue Madonna's main value over replacement synth-pop is his falsetto, capable of reaching a glam-rock frenzy but constrained in songs that never quite allow him to go there."
Pitchfork,Between Two Shores,57,"Between Two Shores was cobbled together out of songs left over from past sessions and home demos. This helps explain the album's lack of focus. What's missing is a singular idea for a listener to rest her headphones on. Instead, we get a hodgepodge of sentimental tunes that aren't quite parallel, perpendicular, or adjacent to each other."
Pitchfork,The House,64,"Punctuating The House's actual songs are occasionally baffling interludes (one, '’Äkeren,' is sung entirely in Norwegian, a first for Porches), which play more like unfinished sketches than intentional moments of quiet."
Pitchfork,A Day With The Homies [EP],66,"It can be hard to square the bleakness of the lyrics with the verdant excess of the sound, though its lo-fi sonics certainly match the rawness of the emotions contained within."
Pitchfork,The  Official Body,81,"The trio is so refreshing and exhilarating because of the space they elbow-out for themselves and the vibrant spirit they pump into the exhausted genre, proving that simply adding some cavernous echo to a track isn't enough."
Pitchfork,Ruins,64,"Their voices complement each other so naturally and so gracefully that it's easy to forget how much craft there is in these songs, and how much ingenuity they put into their vocals."
Pitchfork,Semicircle,63,"After five albums, it's nostalgic sleight-of-hand for the Go! Team to continually look back on the sounds of the '60s yet still tune out the underlying noise of that radical decade."
Pitchfork,Songs of Praise,75,It's taut but it's also a shambles; cramped and ready to rupture with the despair of five unruly lads.
Pitchfork,Camila,68,"Camila shines when it's light and breezy, giving Cabello the space she needs to cook."
Pitchfork,Wrong Creatures,58,"While they're not radically altering their own musical DNA, they are still in their own way trying to figure out what they can and cannot do. While that probably sounds like a backhanded compliment for these rock'n'roll veterans, it might actually be the secret to their longevity."
Pitchfork,The Wasted Years [Box Set],67,"The Wasted Years, despite its sardonic title, is a worthwhile look back at the path he took to get to those heights. While it's not a complete document of the band's startŠ—”this set ignores standalone singles and b-sides from this era, like a rollicking cover of the Modern Lovers' 'Roadrunner'--it sets the table for a three-decade-plus journey that continues to surprise, confound, and satisfy."
Pitchfork,Lex,71,"Though less memorable than its predecessor, Lex succeeds when it is heard as intended: as a conceptual companion to Reassemblage's opaque experimentation, an appendix of utopian ideas that adds nuance and provocation to a seductive sound world where East meets West, and breath and circuitry are made one."
Pitchfork,POST-,82,"While the subject matter of POST- ensures its relevance and substance, much like everything else Rosenstock has ever done, it also sounds like the most fun thing one could possibly do. It's a motivation to, at the very least, get out of bed."
Pitchfork,Rainbow Mirror,62,"For all its imposing scale, though, it lacks some of the dramatic finesse of classic Prurient. Fernow's poetic lyrics, spoken or shrieked, have been a key hallmark of the project, and without them, these abstracted noisescapes lack the narrative character of his best work."
Pitchfork,Mount Qaf (Divine Love),70,"Flourishing in his own way outside the Walkmen, Bauer has found a method of combining two dissimilar passions into art that honors them both."
Exclaim,Woody Guthrie: The Tribute Concerts,80,"Outside of nostalgia, though, much of the work still feels necessary."
Exclaim,All Together Again,70,All Together Now is a surprisingly and satisfyingly listenable collection of compositions that weren't necessarily recorded for this type of public consumption.
Exclaim,"How to Solve Our Human Problems, Pt. 1 [EP]",60,"Despite the EP's virtues, that's a lot of excess fluff for a collection with just five tracks."
Exclaim,Material Control,80,Material Control is an invigorating yet familiar release from the band and by far their angriest and densest music to date.
Exclaim,Finding Shore,80,"Many avant-garde instrumental albums exist to strictly craft a mood, and Tom Rogerson and Brian Eno somehow seem to merge these moods, sounds and themes together effortlessly and radiantly on Finding Shore."
Exclaim,Radio Silence,80,"Radio Silence is a jazzy, soulful call to action, a think-piece and a middle-finger to the trolls who claim he fell off; you can still find his name ""in the middle of equality."""
Exclaim,Post Self,90,"Even though Post Self isn't exactly what was expected, it's a masterful release from two musicians who seem to be incapable of creating anything short of exquisite."
Exclaim,War & Leisure,80,"Though he enthusiastically pushes the boundaries of his sound and image on his most eclectic album yet, Miguel also takes care to make each of its tracks insatiably catchy and breezily fun."
Exclaim,Weighing of the Heart,50,"Weighing of the Heart plays out as the soundtrack to a forgotten '90s B movie; novel, but not great."
Exclaim,In An Open Field,80,"There is self-deprecation and honesty to In an Open Field that combines with musical prowess to form a thoroughly enjoyable, thoughtful record. Few writers possess the melodic ability and communicative skill that Nicholas Krgovich does. He remains one of the finest pop songwriters along the coast."
Exclaim,Birdie,80,"While musically, the tracks can sometimes bleed into each other, sounding perhaps too similar, this album is meant to be consumed in order as a whole. Birdie sets a solid foundation for Slaughter Beach, Dog's future."
Exclaim,Morning After,70,"With the cohesive and captivating Morning After, dvsn have used soothing vocals and layered beats to paint a sonic portrait of modern R&B."
Exclaim,Songs of Experience,50,"Experience neither recaptures past glories nor forges a new way forward, and while it's better than its predecessor, it nevertheless captures the sound of a legacy rock band stuck in neutral."
Exclaim,(It Was) Because I Was In Love [Deluxe Reissue],80,The more transparent mix dovetails nicely with the album's themes.
Exclaim,Utopia,90,Utopia feels like both a journey and a collection of statements that define and affirm who Bj’_rk is.
Exclaim,Syre,80,"At first listen, the album is scattered and slightly exhausting; it takes several attempts to make sense of everything you're hearing, and some listeners may run out of the patience required to dissect it all. Those with a longer attention span, though, will find SYRE a very promising debut that offers new delight with every play."
Exclaim,Soul of a Woman,90,Soul of a Woman is a more than worthy farewell by one of the hardest working and talented women show business has ever known.
Exclaim,Four Lost Souls,70,"Although many songs lack the fire and passion that defined his earlier work, with the exception of the race-relation lyrical content of ""What's My Name?"" and the growling ""Snake Behind Glass,"" Four Lost Souls is simply unlike anything else in Jon Langford's sprawling discography."
Exclaim,Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light,80,"This is the kind of odd, idiosyncratic record that makes collaboration so compelling; whether or not it appeals to you, there's absolutely no way you've heard a metal release quite like it this year."
Exclaim,Mechanics of Dominion,90,"It's a delicate, cautious demonstration, but Mechanics of Dominion is a bold, gripping and brilliantly nuanced addition to Esmerine's gorgeous catalogue, swelling with hope and brimming with energy."
Exclaim,Rest,70,"The pacing of Rest and the length of its songs make it a grower of an album that, over time, ensconces listeners in the sonic layers and personal lyricism of Gainsbourg."
Exclaim,If All I Was Was Black,70,"If All I Was Was Black is another late-career winner from Staples, an album that perfectly captures her gentle, loving and elegant way of making a political statement without sacrificing the passion she's built her career upon."
Exclaim,Wizard Bloody Wizard,60,"Nihilistic chugging riffs permeate the album from beginning to end, thundering away and drilling a particular tempo into your head. But this repetition isn't served by the sort of groove that previously was a keystone to Electric Wizard's sound."
Exclaim,reputation,70,"1989 fans will breathe a sigh of relief when ""I Did Something Bad"" kicks in, though, which starts off a string of shiny pop songs that not only feel like a more natural progression from the last album, but improve upon each listen in that sneaky way Swift songs tend to do. ... The moments on Reputation that Swift stans appreciate the most are likely the ones casual listeners will be quickest to dismiss."
Exclaim,Arpo,70,"Arpo forges lush soundscapes by drawing on ASMR techniques, layering textures over the arpeggiated hooks that drive the record. A saxophone player himself, Call Super subtly peppers hazy woodwind tones throughout, elevating the record's otherwise eclectic collage of electronic soundscapes."
Exclaim,Interiors,80,Interiors can proudly call itself a rightful successor to the post-hardcore classics status of their first two albums.
Exclaim,Phases,80,"Here, she moves through songs about love and life that, whether because of the cavernous, sometimes tinny production or her timeless songwriting style (and often, both), feel channelled from some ghostly past where musical arrangement was simpler but emotions weren't."
Exclaim,Without Warning,70,"The trio's intent is crystal clear here: make hypnotic murder rap that evokes a screwface and head-nod. If horror movies aren't your thing, though, Without Warning might not be the rap project for you."
Exclaim,The Animal Spirits,80,"On his third LP, James Holden establishes a sound wholly his own, allowing The Animal Spirits' gorgeous, absorbing and wonderfully unkempt mix of psych, jazz, folk and electronic to infiltrate the listener's psyche."
Exclaim,Reworked by Detroiters,70,"This compilation shows the lasting impact Funkadelic has had on popular culture and on subsequent generations of innovators, striking a balance between reverence for the originals and creativity from the re-visitors."
The 405,Turn Out the Lights,90,"What elevates Turn Out The Lights is that it's sensory as well as earnest, personally destabilising while artfully assured; it oscillates in the spilling synaesthesia of panic attacks, the dizzying clarity of epiphany, the paralysing futility of depressive episodes, the unfathomable locus of being okay."
The 405,Milano,70,The album is an engaging and enjoyable listen and deserves all the credit it will inevitably receive.
The 405,"A  Flame My Love, a Frequency",75,"Ultimately, A flame my love, a frequency is an intimate voyage of a single human soul through nature, and the minimalistic synth compositions she has used to render this prove to be an ideal vessel."
The 405,Anthology: Movie Themes 1974-1998,100,Carpenter here brings together the themes from 13 of his movies to remind us exactly how pervasive is his influence on modern culture.
The 405,Ken,80,"This album scales back significantly from the relative bombast of the grand Poison Season in favor of a more intimate, simple setting. Stranding himself nearly alone--aside from longtime collaborator Josh Wells--Bejar hunkered down to record the simultaneously unconcerned and emotional splash that is ken."
The 405,Open,80,"For those of us all too invested in the constant slew of bigger, louder, more flashy presentations every week, it's a true pleasure to get lost in such a graceful, deceptively simple world. Open is a true treat."
The 405,It's Alright Between Us as It Is,75,"There's a balance to be struck between playing it safe and playing it smart, and Lindstr’Ùm leans more towards the latter. If he occasionally veers the wrong way, he recovers handsomely."
The 405,Mr. Davis,55,"Mr. Davis seems to pull in every direction at once. Gucci himself, despite the attempted show of a triumphant album, largely seems to feel somber."
The 405,Ogilala,65,"Ogilala lives and dies by the strength of its songwriting, and while there's nothing here that even sniffs at the coattails of Corgan's best work, it is probably the most consistent and least offensively pretentious album he's put out in, well, nineteen years."
The 405,Boxing the Moonlight,70,"It makes for a veritable smorgasbord of genre pastiche wherein there is plenty of fun to be had in simply trying to pinpoint the artist or even specific song that is being aped. On the other hand, it also makes for a bit of a hit and miss affair."
The 405,Lotta Sea Lice,80,"Although Lotta Sea Lice didn't exactly live up to it's potential and hype, the end result is still something to be reckoned with; a fascinating and balanced attempt at perfecting the concept of the collaboration album."
The 405,Colors,60,"Overall it's a fun album of two halves. The first half tows the line between the cheesy elements of radio pop that even the snarkiest Slayer fan secretly loves, and some truly inspirational, if not fleeting, compositional substance. The second half, although still very much a fun listen, somewhat strays."
The 405,The Saga Continues,55,"The Saga Continues, despite being a passably entertaining listen, is a grimmer entry, as there seems to be no concern for their legacy left."
The 405,Masseduction,80,"From the very start you can hear and see the ideas that were explored in the clips and videos stretched to their fullest, most histrionic range."
The 405,Take Me Apart,90,"Take Me Apart doesn't feel desperate to reach for anything, it is comfortable, prepared for whatever may come, much like its bearer. Greatness hasn't sounded this natural in this arena for some time. This is everything."
The 405,Tenderness,70,"In some of its explorations of dance music's sub-genres it is less successful, and can come off as a bit too cheesy for its own good, but it's all produced, performed and sequenced with such careful consideration and bountiful charm, that its few shortcomings in pure songwriting terms can be overlooked."
The 405,Three Futures,75,"The music is now lush where once it was loud, layered and thoughtful where it was immediate."
The 405,The Kid,80,"Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith looks at life and sees the endless possibility. It's a sweet thought, and a compelling journey."
The 405,Offering,70,"There's plenty of fun to be had here, even if it can't help not quite measuring up to past hype."
The 405,New Energy,80,"To say New Energy is a consolidation rather than a progression may seem damning with faint praise, but its palate is so substantial and nourishing that such slight ambition is peripheral. If you're served a basic carbonara by a Michelin-star pasta chef it's still a damn fine carbonara."
The 405,The Centre Cannot Hold,85,"Rather than betting the farm on a couple showstoppers while keeping everything else relatively muted and inconspicuous, Frost pushes himself further and further and creates an incredible experience."
The 405,Always Foreign,95,"With this album, The World is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die has stepped up to the challenge of their name (as well as their previous lyrics riffing off the name), and show that they are willing to fight to make it a reality. While this battle may be a substantially uphill one, Always Foreign stands as an impeccable call to arms."
The 405,Relatives in Descent,75,"Relatives in Descent, right down to its title, is an enigma of free thought and aggressive, yet powerful sentiment."
The 405,Music for the Age of Miracles,85,"More than ever, the human experience is tangible through their music, and they manage to create those unmaintainable moments of joy that can, in a moment or a movement, dissolve into something else entirely; a memory of something long forgotten, a vision of your inconsequentiality in the world, a realisation that everything is temporary. Fortunately, they are not always downers, moreover it just feels comforting to have those feelings quantified so stirringly through music."
The 405,Haiku from Zero,60,"Haiku From Zero offers up plenty of mesmerising moments, but they come with a damaging amount of baggage and ultimately the record falls a little short of the tropical dream that it envisages."
The 405,Hiss Spun,90,"After years of delivering on her promise, it comes as no surprise that Hiss Spun is as good as it is. The instrumental tracks dance around Wolfe's soaring vocals and ultimately collide with them perfectly to create a collection of songs that are a joy to listen to."
The 405,The Spark,30,"Ultimately, The Spark presents a baffling listening experience. Almost every song on the album poses as an unremarkable backdrop onto which the band fiddles with elements of everything from grime to orchestral arrangements with virtually no successful results."
The 405,Luciferian Towers,95,"It's still a functionally and otherwise dazzling work, one that sits nicely among the band's compositions."
The 405,Brick Body Kids Still Daydream,80,"Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is the very definition of a slow burner. It lacks a track as instantly iconic as 'Doug Stamper' off Dark Comedy, but it reveals its layers and details gradually."
The 405,Aromanticism,90,"Aromanticism is an album that is heartfelt and heartbreaking, and, from the opening chorals to the closing moments of 'Self Help Tape', is an album like no other."
Kerrang!,Dear,80,"Dear has generated a resurrection, or at least a strengthening of their life force; its creation inspired Boris to continue, turning what was supposed to be a goodbye into a forceful restating of this remarkable band's existence. [1 Jul 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Precious Art,80,"This is the release that finally sees the band hit their songwriting stride. [1 Jul 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Trouble Maker,60,"Rancid don't do anything new here, but they sound more fired-up than ever. [1 Jul 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,GN,80,"It has to be said that this is more of a nice vibe record than it is one full of great standalone songs, but when the vibe created is as utterly charming as this, that can only be a minor gripe. [1 Jul 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,A Walk With Love and Death,60,"It finds the band indulging their darkest urges, often using nothing more than noise and soundscapes. Like everything the Melvins do, however, it remains compelling, clever, and absolutely unique. [24 Jun 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Hydrograd,80,"Hydrograd is an altogether looser, more accessible creation. [24 Jun 24, 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Gravebloom,60,"The whole thing is suitably drenched with nihilism, once more conveying the sense that, in their world, smiles should result in a beating, because everything is truly hopeless. [1 Jul 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Life is Good,40,"There are also songs that will undoubtedly kick it live, but it's not enough to prevent this from sounding merely ...nice. [10 Jun 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,The Optimist,80,"A band finding new ways to be magnificent so far into their career. [10 Jun 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Living Arrangements,60,"This album is long. [10 Jun 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Two Parts Viper,80,"There's a quivering blues element to the sludgy stomp of Whether Terrified Or Unafraid, while elsewhere they twist the lo-fi fuzz into jarring alt.rock shapes, as Josh continues to serve up the deliciously unexpected. [10 Jun 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,The Amazons,60,"Holy Roller packs all the cloying jangle of a thousand mid-'00s forgotten filler tracks, while closer Palace doesn't so much dampen gunpowder as drop curtain with a watery ""plop."" But swagger frequently outweigh s stumble, and the band's innate sense of class shines brightly throughout. [10 Jun 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Singles [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] [Deluxe Edition],100,"Already an essential document to one of rock's most exciting periods, the heartbreaking poignancy these bonus tracks add now make it even more so. [3 Jun 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,You're Welcome,40,"You're Welcome stumbles through grating doldrums on garage-rock autopilot, with junkyard fuzz that's more crap-nasty than good-nasty. [3 Jun 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Wolves,100,"More often than not, though, Rise Against let you reach your own conclusions, and therein lies the difference between merely preaching to the choir and reaching the whole congregation. [3 Jun 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Popular Music,80,"It's certainly an album fuelled by dissatisfaction, but it's more frantic than furious. [27 May 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Last Young Renegade,80,"Several bold steps forward, while looking back over one shoulder. [27 May 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Reaching Into Infinity,60,"It's hardly a reinvention, but it all adds to the OTT party DragonForce have been throwing for so long. [20 May 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Sacred,80,"Little has changed. [8 May 2017, p.69]"
Kerrang!,United States of Horror,80,"An uncompromising debut--hard, nasty and the perfect sonic poison for 2017. [29 Apr 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,One More Light,60,"A record that's at times so flat. [13 May 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,In Spades,80,"The record flows effortlessly from disco to all-out rock ballad, and it ends with a stunningly atmospheric climax only they can pull off. [6 May 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Gargoyle,80,"This is an album that sounds of box-fresh offerings foma shop-worn veteran in which everything about it suits him well. [6 May 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Pageant,80,"Nakedly confessional or all dressed up, this is an album to cherish. [6 May 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,inŠ—¢ter aŠ—¢liŠ—¢a,80,"Across 11 tracks InŠ—¢ter aŠ—¢liŠ—¢a never loses focus and never takes the easy options, offering fractured anthems for fractured times. [6 May 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,8,40,"8 isn't terrible, but it is boring, which is much worse. [13 May 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Graveyard Shift,80,"Ambitious and controversial, it's a creditable pass that's not perfect, but has flashes of brilliance. [29 Apr 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,The Walls Will Fall [EP],80,"Played at the correct volume, this will certainly threaten the structural stability of your house. [22 Apr 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,You Are We,80,"It's an album that bristles with hooks, crackles with power and almost overflows with passion. [22 Apr 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Wick,100,"A wonderful rewarding journey. [15 Apr 2017, p.50]"
DJ Booth,I Am Not a Human Being II,60,"He's obviously still capable of moments of greatness, but right now those moments are so dulled by surrounding mediocrity they're becoming lost."
DJ Booth,The 20/20 Experience,80,Timberlake and Timbaland (Timbalake?) are at their best when they rely more on organic soul than samples.
DJ Booth,No Love Lost,80,"With Joe's distinct style steering every track, No Love Lost is a much more cohesive and focused work, despite similar fluctuations [to Slaughterhouse's Welcome To: Our House]."
DJ Booth,Long.Live.A$AP,80,In many ways Long.Live.A$AP is an album of the present.
DJ Booth,Jesus Piece,70,"Jesus Piece certainly isn't his best album, but if it ends up being his worst, then Jayceon's doing pretty damn good for himself."
DJ Booth,Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head,80,"T.I. is more lyrical than he often gets credit for, but it's his ""swag"" that truly separates him from the crowd, and Trouble Man is dripping with so much swag T.I. should bottle it and sell it."
DJ Booth,Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors,90,"For two solo albums now Andre Patton has not merely proved that he's a capable solo artist, he's helping to redefine what a hip-hop album can sound like."
DJ Booth,O.N.I.F.C.,70,"O.N.I.F.C. isn't a great album, but it isn't lazy either."
DJ Booth,Unapologetic,60,"Unapologetic is by no means a bad album, it'd be nearly impossible to combine the music industry's best songwriters, producers and Rihanna's charismatic delivery and not create quality music, but as an album Unapologetic has no real core, no real theme; unless you count ""making hits"" as a theme."
DJ Booth,Trilogy,90,"Ultimately, Trilogy is more of a sonic landmark then it is a new work."
DJ Booth,Dreams and Nightmares,70,"We can safely assume that Dreams and Nightmares is the best Meek can possibly muster. And if this is indeed Meek's best, Meek's best is pretty good."
DJ Booth,Lace Up,70,"Maintaining the same ""burn down the building"" energy that your most loyal fans demand while not actually burning down the building is no easy task, but it's a fine line that MGK mostly manages to walk with success on Lace Up."
DJ Booth,The  Heist,80,"Ultimately, these songs and all of the songs on the album are stories, and to call Macklemore a storytelling rapper would be an understatement. He only tells stories, most often his own, it just turns out he's the kind of gifted storyteller that can keep you listening."
DJ Booth,"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City",100,He's given us all he could possibly give us; an album worthy of being called a classic.
DJ Booth,Payback,80,"Payback sounds more like a catharsis, an extended musical middle finger filled with the kind of instrumental interludes, frenetic humor and unconstrained personality that will leave heads nodding, and Clear Channel running in the opposite direction."
DJ Booth,Kaleidoscope Dream,80,There's no doubting that he's gone from a freshman to a full-fledged member of R&B's graduating class with Kaleidoscope Dream.
DJ Booth,This Generation,80,"Music this good transcends chronology, so whether you're 85 (what up grandma?), just getting your driver's license or anywhere between, you're all welcome into This Generation."
DJ Booth,"Food & Liquor, Vol. 2: the Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1",90,"It has its own moments of pop-leaning lightness, but there's more than enough revolutionary material here to leave the faithful satiated."
DJ Booth,Cruel Summer,70,"While everyone else is solid, there are no epiphanies, no ""that artist is the next to blow!"" moment that particularly deserves mention."
DJ Booth,Based on a T.R.U. Story,60,"Based on a T.R.U. Story isn't a great album, but was anyone expecting a great album from 2 Chainz?"
DJ Booth,Chapter V,80,"Songz isn't doing anything new, but when he's still delivering music this high quality it really doesn't matter that much."
DJ Booth,Welcome To: Our House,70,"At 16 tracks, 20 on the deluxe version, this album manages to work in more than a couple joints featuring some of the vicious rap hardcore fans were hoping for."
DJ Booth,Channel Orange,90,"This is more than an album, this is a moment in music history. Enjoy it."
DJ Booth,Life is Good,100,"On his new album, Life Is Good, we're hearing the most locked-in Nas has been in years, and the results are awe-inspiring."
DJ Booth,Fortune,70,"The truth is in the eye of the beholder, and with easily accessible albums like Fortune, there will continue to be a lot of eyes on Chris Brown."
DJ Booth,"Maybach Music Group Presents: Self Made, Vol. 2",70,"In and of itself, Self Made 2 is a decent album that should find relative success."
DJ Booth,Rugby Thompson,70,"Nothing on the album is groundbreaking and it won't go on to sell millions of copies, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a worthy piece of musical art."
DJ Booth,Looking 4 Myself,80,"Looking 4 Myself isn't a classic, it's just not, but until I hear better, it's the best R&B album of the year."
DJ Booth,"Triple F Life: Friends, Fans and Family",60,"These are good songs, but we don't come to Waka for good."
DJ Booth,The Stoned Immaculate,80,"If you're already a fan of Curren$y I have to imagine you'll at least enjoy adding Immaculate to the collection. And if you're not a Spitta fan there's a solid chance that Immaculate will, if not convert you to a full-fledged fan, at the very least respect the man."
Paste Magazine,The Ooz,91,"This is not an album to absorb in desperate moments, but rather an artfully brooding, grime-y thing that stands as a terribly unique and nightmarish account of what it could sound like to spiral out of control."
Paste Magazine,Visions of a Life,81,There's no denying Visions Of A Life top marks for a sterling sophomore effort.
Paste Magazine,Lotta Sea Lice,85,"By eschewing ambition in favor of intimacy, the album is both comfortable and comforting. While Barnett and Vile don't travel far from their established sounds in their collaboration, the sum of their contributions yields fresh results."
Paste Magazine,Relatives in Descent,89,"While his band has grown into a post-punk monster, Casey, too, has moved beyond his personal frets and frustrations and developed into a lyricist capable of clear and compelling commentary. He's a voice worth listening to. It took a while, but thank goodness he found his way to the front of a band."
Paste Magazine,Cry Cry Cry,85,"That seven-year break might have been just what Wolf Parade needed to regroup and come back even stronger than before, and Cry Cry Cry shows that guitar rock is far from dead."
Paste Magazine,Brand New Abyss,66,"Even the more listenable songs on Brand New Abyss, such as 'So There' and 'The Woman You Want,' sound more like a successful regurgitation of past sounds and ideas than anything new. And while that's not a bad thing, it's not enough of a reason to spend time listening to the new album."
Paste Magazine,As You Were,67,"The biggest and most welcome surprise is that As You Were is not only a cohesive, fluid record, but shows that at age 45, 'our kid' isn't ready to go away just yet."
Paste Magazine,Fatherland,56,"It's just a shame that what lies behind dozens of layers of metaphorical shrouds, isn't a bit more poetic and interesting."
Paste Magazine,Rule 62,83,"What's particularly striking here is how Rose matches credence with confidence. Her voice, a gentle and unassuming croon, gives her material a quiet caress, making them effortlessly engaging each time out."
Paste Magazine,Three Futures,80,"She's still a sprinter on Three Futures. But she looks back at what's been lost with accrued wisdom and a literary eye for sensual detail, resulting in one of the year's most thoughtful left turns."
Paste Magazine,Sorry Is Gone,87,"The band emphasizes Mayfield's heroic message, fueling their instruments with triumphant riffs and raw, stopping-for-no-one licks."
Paste Magazine,Sky Trails,65,"Caught between preserving his sound and experimenting with new ones, David Crosby lacks a firm musical identity on this new album. Hopefully, he finds a way to incorporate modern elements into his songs more effectively."
Paste Magazine,Harmony of Difference [EP],84,"On Harmony of Difference, Washington's work remains as substantial and compelling as ever, and with any luck this EP is setting the scene for another, longer release from him soon."
Paste Magazine,Hallelujah Anyhow,86,"On Hallelujah Anyhow, he sounds more comfortable than ever before, and that's saying something. Taylor's songs are warm and well-worn. His band moves as a single organism. ... Musically, Hallelujah Anyhow is a beautiful patchwork of styles."
Paste Magazine,Multi-Task,76,"Multi-task hits its high marks when the band is doing as much as it can, or, if you will, multi-tasking."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Sorry To Bother You,91,"Boots Riley has at his disposal a rich, seldom-tapped seam of scathing rhetoric and concrete metaphor and fleshes out leftist analysis with humanist muscle and poetic integument."
Paste Magazine,Everybody Knows,58,"Unfortunately, Everybody Knows is the sound of two classic artists playing the 18th hole of their intertwined and decorated careers."
Paste Magazine,Wonderful Wonderful,73,"The beauty of The Killers is that you can start at any point. Each album is as good as the last and those that came after it. To that end, Wonderful Wonderful works as a perfect introduction or a delightful continuation."
Paste Magazine,A Sentimental Education,68,The performances here stick too closely to the source material to offer anything truly exciting or gripping.
Paste Magazine,Concrete and Gold,73,Grohl and company could have continued to make mundane arena rock. That they've managed to hunker down and create a collection that proves that they aren't ready crawl fade away just yet.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The  Heist,83,"I find only the alcoholic's confession ""Neon Cathedral"" too much, and that one's counteracted by the relapser's confession ""Starting Over,"" just as ""Sayin' `That's poetry, it's so well-spoken,' stop it"" counteracts his art talk. He's especially good on old cars and old clothes."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),12 Bit Blues,91,"After more time than anyone from either camp will be inclined to give it, the album takes on a compelling, sui generis sonic identity, at least for someone from the blues side."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Coexist,91,They add up to a song cycle with a happy ending--the joy of which may grow in wisdom or crumble back toward nothingness tomorrow.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Cruel Summer,83,"The surprise is that the attention requires so little effort, because there's always a musical touch to keep you alert."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Living for a Song: A Tribute to Hank Cochran,91,"Vocally, duet partners from 41-year-old Alison Krauss to 86-year-old Ray Price outdo themselves keeping the young powerhouse in check&#8209;-only on the ill-advised showcase does Johnson get to show off."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Twenty-Five for the Rest of Our Lives,83,"More than half the songs sound effectively the same. Rocking, absolutely. Tighter, too. Tuneful, in their way."
Paste Magazine,Strange Peace,78,It's refreshing to know there are bands like METZ putting out such quality rage like the 11 songs on this most exceptionally enthralling hello for today's youth to thrash along to with the same sense of reckless abandon their parents were able to extol as members of the Sub Pop Singles Club.
Paste Magazine,Plum,91,"Wand's many talents are given full plumage on Plum. It will be interesting to see in what directions the band surveys in future albums. For now, this is about as interesting a new rock record you could hope to listen to."
Paste Magazine,The Laughing Apple,76,"Yusuf's vocals are a bit more gruff than in days gone by, but his whimsical tone maintains the fanciful and philosophical lilt once so essential to that early, engaging style."
Paste Magazine,Saturn Over Sunset,69,"After traveling through 13 tracks, unaware of how much time has passed or all the strange places in your mind you've traveled to, arriving at 'Their Eyes' does have a very similar feeling to stepping out into the sunlight after the dark cocoon of the movie theatre--a little unsure of what you've just seen."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Sing the Delta,91,"DeMent craves stuff she can ""see and touch,"" but her songwriting makes do just fine with feeling."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Glad Rag Doll,83,"[Glad Rag Doll] brings out the warmth in a voice that's been chilly, verging on aloof, at times. She calls this her ""song and dance record""; I'd call it her nimble, witty, change-of-pace record."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Night & Day,91,"These 13-songs-in-35-minut&#8203;es, cut half in 2008 when he was drunk and half in 2010 when he was sober, are shockingly strong for the first eight or nine, which unfortunately include all the drunk ones."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The  Truth About Love,100,"Until the last two songs, whose overwrought drama I don't have to like just because I trust its verisimilitude, they hit every time."
Paste Magazine,New Magic,84,"Rootsier than his self-titled debut and all the stronger for it, Livingston's latest dials back the busy modern rock production and psych-blues noise to reveal songwriting that is more classic yet less predictable, and enchanting in its spare intimacy."
Paste Magazine,Mareridt,83,"If Myrkur is a black metal artist, 'Crown' is the sound of her pushing and pulling hard on the genre's boundaries. The strongest stretch of Mareridt, however, is three songs on its back end. First up is 'Funeral,' a swirl of blackened sludge that moves at the pace of, well, a funeral procession."
Paste Magazine,The Hanged Man,75,"The Hanged Man, despite some of its thinness and unevenness, is still a great record."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Kill My Blues,91,"She's slightly slower and considerably more melodramatic, as is only appropriate. Other times the melodrama appears merely the organic outcome of a larger-than-life voice."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance,83,"Sweetly skeletal arrangements featuring various bandmates and his bassist dad underpin the quietest and most winning singing of his career, with lyrics so crystalline you never need the booklet."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Elysium,91,The understated beats suit their elysian equanimity.
Paste Magazine,Okovi,82,"Danilova's vocal fluidity is what drives the record most. She's dramatic (without being overly so), deeply powerful and passionate, whether she's expressing anger, desperation or love."
Paste Magazine,Try Not To Freak Out,74,Try Not To Freak Out is a solid rock record throughout.
Paste Magazine,Hippopotamus,89,"It may rank as one of their best outings yet, as its multifaceted compositional creativity, coupled with its consistently fetching melodies and words, makes it a thoroughly impressive and engaging listen. As always, Sparks shows its stylistic siblings how it's truly done."
Paste Magazine,Half-Light,74,"Longing and heartbreak are universal themes, but what Rostam does is make them accessible, thought-provoking in an artful manner that will serve him well in as he navigates his solo career."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Tempest,83,"How much you admire this record will depend on how redolent you find two of them: the quiet jeremiad ""Scarlet Town"" and the quieter love-triangle cut-'em-up ""Tin Angel."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Fragrant World,83,Almost every track offers up at least a snatch of melody you're always glad to hear again.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),A Thing Called Divine Fits,91,"In short, this rocks differently in a year when it's been hard to use that verb without reflecting on the mortality of all things."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),En Yay Sah,91,"These grooves vary structurally&#8209;-hooked&#8203; by a bass drone, an insistent drum pattern, some fetching keyb. And they always move."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Bouger le Monde!,91,"Though capable lead vocalist Ricky Likabu and startling high tenor Theo Nzonza don't soar on record the way they do live, both lift audibly out of the wheeled conveyances from which a gang of polio survivors articulated their humanity and launched their inspired hustle."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Section.80,83,"Just when you're thinking not bad at all, come some songs."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Control System,91,"He's just a gifted kid who likes his weed and his words, which he twists with palpable delight around sparse synth beats musical enough to layer on some delight of their own."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Election Special,83,I give him extra credit for both preaching to the converted and doing his damnedest to rally the holier-than-thou.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),C.A.R.,91,"Anticon minimalist Odd Nosdam provides all the beats Geti needs, and when your mind wanders, quite often the music alone carries you along."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),African Electronic Music 1975-1982,91,"Though half are also on La Condition Masculine, which is generally deemed Bebey's best album, this selection is hookier from the just-released ""New Track,"" whose subject is white starchy foods, to ""The Coffee Cola Song,"" whose subject is the cash economy."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),What We Saw from the Cheap Seats,83,"Many of these songs are merely bemused, and when she revises ""I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,"" all she achieves is a different singalong from the one you expected."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The Idler Wheel Is Wiser than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More than Ropes Will Ever Do,91,An album that's damn catchy after all.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Covered,83,"Fun as it is to hear her do ""Creep,"" ""Teenagers,"" and ""Smoke Two Joints,"" this is a bigger mess than it had to be."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Channel Orange,91,"The musical craft on this almost sampleless album is so even-keeled that there's no song here as forgettable as ""There Will Be Tears"" or ""Dust"" either."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Words & Music by Saint Etienne,91,Her male partners Bob Stanley and Peter Wiggs provide reliable disco-inflected pop or vice versa that the remixers on the optional bonus disc trick up with more wit and fidelity than we who avoid remixes sagely expect.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Kindred [EP],91,"The six tracks divided evenly between his 20-minute 2011 return and his 30-minute 2012 stride forward, cohere almost seamlessly as the album they become when you don't have to turn any plastic over."
The Boston Phoenix,Field Report,75,"If a breathy, acoustic aquarium is up your alley, then take the dive and swim alongside Porterfield's magical lyricism."
The Boston Phoenix,Total Loss,75,"whereas Krell's keening, pleading falsetto dominated Love Remains, Total Loss finds him granting the rest of his sonic palette more prominence."
The Boston Phoenix,Sundowning,75,Her [Andrea Lukic] presence makes Sundowning cathartic--if not downright life-affirming.
The Boston Phoenix,Mirage Rock,75,"Mirage Rock might as well be the name of a new airy-rock subgenre, with luscious, echoey story-tunes rolling in like a soft mirage-inducing mountain fog."
The Boston Phoenix,I Bet on Sky,75,"[A] terrific, visceral album."
The Boston Phoenix,Sun,50,"Bland, quasi-political lyrics and zonked-out, dead-end textures."
The Boston Phoenix,Rhythm and Repose,75,"Hansard gave himself a hard act to follow, but he pulls it off with Repose. He doesn't shun the sound that made the Once soundtrack a hit, but he does expand his palette and show off the breadth of his songwriting prowess."
The Boston Phoenix,Freak Out!,75,"The lack of innovation is frustrating, since these guys nailed this formula long ago, but they mostly make up for the lack of newness by expending insane amounts of energy."
The Boston Phoenix,Tornado,75,Little Big Town make implicit the debt they owe to the California rock of Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles in a way that makes Little Big Town seem fresh and thrilling compared to most other Music Row acts.
The Boston Phoenix,Observator,75,It's a crucial listen and one of the most rewarding releases of 2012.
The Boston Phoenix,Coexist,75,"At a certain point, the xx need to turn off that reverb pedal and learn to sing above a whisper - but I'll be damned if they haven't worked their magic again."
The Boston Phoenix,The National Health,88,"A no-frills, consistently engaging album with heart - and hooks - to spare."
The Boston Phoenix,Standing at the Sky's Edge,100,"This may be the most uncharacteristic of his albums, but by venturing outside his comfort zone, Hawley has in turn made his best."
The Boston Phoenix,Blood,75,"In This Moment are up to some weird, wild, wonderful stuff."
The Boston Phoenix,Silver Age,88,Silver Age is the best album Mould has released since his days in Sugar.
The Boston Phoenix,Antibalas,88,"Stripped down to a bare, live-band essence, and with the old-school touch of Roth/Daptone, Antibalas go places by simply playing it safe."
The Boston Phoenix,Mature Themes,88,Mature Themes is paced with brilliance.
The Boston Phoenix,Breakup Song,88,"With your headphones strapped, the album's dirty optimism will brighten even the darkest, stalest airport-layover experience (true story)."
The Boston Phoenix,Hot Cakes,63,"Light on laughs and riffage, the title/cover entendre makes it hard to tell if it is supposed to be so terrible or a joke about being so terrible... But the long-available cover of Radiohead's ""Street Spirit"" is inspired, and first single ""Nothin's Gonna Stop Us"" grafts one candy rope hook after another into one of the year's finest melodies."
The Boston Phoenix,Beams,75,"It's the album's more subdued tail end, particularly ""Ahead of Myself"" and ""Temptation,"" that shows a songwriter rising above his comfort zone to deliver a career-defining transition."
The Boston Phoenix,Centipede Hz,88,"It's perhaps overly long (53 minutes) and hard to penetrate, but Animal Collective's creativity glows brighter than Ric Flair's hair."
The Boston Phoenix,The Seer,63,"Gira's career has been one of violations and risks; there are plenty here. However, his trademark brand of post-rock/ambient alienation may finally leave listeners indifferent."
The Boston Phoenix,Steam Days,50,"Steam Days is usually pretty, but it's also a snooze."
The Boston Phoenix,Havoc and Bright Lights,63,Sometimes it gets too cheerful.
The Boston Phoenix,America,88,"America is a beguiling, remarkable work, a deep, carefully measured, completely idiosyncratic breath released on the dawn of a promising day."
The Boston Phoenix,Ascent,75,"Ascent is stuffed with psychedelic guitar virtuosity, moments where Chasny leaves this plane and enters one of those transcendental, mind-freaked, head-tipped-back, eyelid-fluttering states that few are capable of."
The Boston Phoenix,Election Special,75,"Cooder, like a Keith Richards/Woody Guthrie hybrid, observes [the current political scene] all as a damn shame, with little condescension and oodles of wit."
The Boston Phoenix,The Killer,75,"Crafted with worn elements of the electronic cannon, his third LP as Shed doesn't offer much that's fresh. Rather, it's nostalgia and recontextualization that drive this effort.... [Yet songs, I Come By Night, You Got the Look, and Follow the Leader] are all indicative of mastery."
The Boston Phoenix,Fragrant World,88,"Yeasayer remain the new-millennium kings of studio manipulation, and it's downright jaw-dropping that they're able to experiment so wildly in the context of such catchiness. Fragrant World feels like a victory lap."
The Boston Phoenix,Blood of My Enemies,25,"Insipid lyrics, absolutely zero feel, and derivative riffs that make Godsmack seem ingenious add up to everything that gives metal a bad name."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Random Access Memories,80,"RAM can oftentimes feel scattered, too ambitious, or too similar to the era it's working from, but, in the end, it's an album held together by that palpable reverence."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Empty Estate [EP],70,"Sometimes pushing the envelope may be a grandiose gesture, other times more subtle, and while Wild Nothing may never be a Brian Eno, there's certainly nothing wrong with being a Felt or Go-Betweens."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Modern Vampires of the City,85,"Modern Vampires of the City finds the band in both familiar and unfamiliar territory, and it's pure pleasure hearing them navigate these waters."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Trouble Will Find Me,85,"Unpredictable it is not, but taken as a study of sound and mood, it's kind of perfect."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Curiosity,72,"It may not be the most instantly appealing of albums, but with a little time it proves itself to be more than its title suggests."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Desperate Ground,59,"While the fury remains, there a perceptible dip in quality in nearly every aspect of the Thermals' formula."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Didn't It Rain,62,It's surprisingly how unaffecting and mediocre most of it is.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Silence Yourself,81,"Since Savages have cultivated such a politicized aesthetic, it's hard to divorce the concept behind the art from the art itself, but Silence Yourself delivers if you are willing to submit to its unflinching authority."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Monomania,75,"It may not reach the same creative highs or artistic wholeness of their previous releases, but in its own right, it can be just as enjoyable."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Sub Verses,68,"Akron/Family are never going to stop changing and you never really know what you're gonna get, but they could perhaps do with a bit more cohesiveness and bit less grandiosity next time around."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),"New History Warfare, Vol. 3: To See More Light",85,"With additional help from fellow musician and frequent collaborator Justin Vernon (whose vocals are the only overdubbed aspect of the music), the songs on To See More Light are as devastatingly personal as they are emphatically otherworldly--inhuman sounding even. This stark dichotomy of sound and intent throws Stetson's music into austere relief."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Fabric 69,85,"Thirty tracks and seventy-five minutes, Fabric 69 is a work of incredibly sturdy sonic architecture; it's hardly inert or monotonous, yet at the same time it takes techno's notion of repetition to what might be considered a logical extreme."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The Marriage of True Minds,76,"The Marriage of True Minds is something of a record built for everyone, a fusion of sounds and ideas built from the thoughts and minds of lots of different people; there will be different moments that deter and attract different people, but there are more than enough of the better ones to keep you hooked for the album's runtime."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Amygdala,85,Nothing here is overtly thrilling but ultimately the record is a real joy to listen to.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Bankrupt!,70,"Bankrupt! suffers because it feels a little detached at times, like you can't really tell where the band are in the big picture."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Impossible Truth,84,"Tunes are built slowly and satisfyingly, ebbing and flowing into oceans of ambient sound. Through these layers, though, shine frequent flashes of utter brilliance."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Twelve Reasons to Die,79,"As a pure entertainment piece, Twelve Reasons To Die appeals directly to the brain's pleasure center."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Mosquito,71,"They're still capable of brilliance (particularly on the opening and closing tracks), but too much of Mosquito is bogged down by tongue-in-cheek frivolity."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Shaking the Habitual,90,"If any record of this relatively young year demands your full attention then Shaking the Habitual is it, as it opens up as a vast chasm of unexpected possibilities, and despite any possible subconscious misgivings, you'll immediately want to jump in without thinking twice."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Excavation,90,"Excavation is vivid and physical, each moment meticulously and purposefully crafted."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Wakin on a Pretty Daze,87,"With any luck, Wakin On A Pretty Daze will go down as a document to the workman he really is."
Splendid,Set Free,80,"It remains to be seen whether this is the record for which American Analog Set's fans have been waiting a decade, but Set Free is definitely one of the most consistent, mature albums they've made to date."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Off the Record,62,"Off the Record, despite a few promising tracks, never provides a strong enough reason for listeners to do anything but go back and admire what he accomplished with Kraftwerk."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),You Are Eternity,81,"Dadub have crafted an LP with depth and subtle yet grand-scale dimension, adding another excellent release to the Stroboscopic Artefacts canon."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Totale Nite,83,Total Nite comes less than a year on from Children of Desire and feels like a natural continuation of their sound.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Overgrown,85,"While James Blake felt aloof, even ahuman, Overgrown is packed with feeling, and releases it with the smallest of gestures."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Wolf,28,Wolf is a serious mess.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The  Terror,77,"As one of the most polarizing records in their extensive discography, this release is sure to divide certain fans, especially those who were disillusioned by the relative inaccessibility of Embryonic. For listeners looking for a noisy and thoroughly experimental album, though, The Terror is just what the doctor ordered."
Splendid,"One Way, It's Every Way",80,"Mitchell is a skilled producer, weaving a tangle of complex melodies and countermelodies, rhythms and accents, into a vibrant tapestry; there's a lot more going on in these songs than you can pick up in one pass."
Splendid,Cripple Crow,80,"While Rejoicing and Ni’±o Rojo were clearer, simpler and more cohesive, Cripple Crow may actually be the better record. It feels exactly like the kind of album Devendra Banhart ought to have playing in his head -- a cacophony of cool sounds, a plethora of contradictory ideas, a patchwork quilt of psychedelically bright colors."
Splendid,Give Blood,70,"The music is comfortable, lacking the self-conscious over-rehearsed feeling of other new bands."
Splendid,Noah's Ark,70,Noah's Ark retrenches CocoRosie in their signature sound and gives us a glimpse of their indubitably eccentric future.
Splendid,Life In Slow Motion,60,"Gray is wise to continue experimenting and testing the boundaries of his art, but his changes don't need to be this bold. In this case, he comes up short: his minimalist mastery does not translate to resounding baroque success."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Czarface,80,"A shining example of what hip-hop should always strive to be, at least to a devoted segment of rap nationalists untroubled by the anachronism of rejecting the clean synth lines of this century's rap in favor of its dusty aesthetics of the early to mid '90s."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Tricolore,69,"Tricolore is enjoyable, but it's a sum of two different parts; together it comes off as strangely disjointed, like shifting from speaking German to speaking Japanese."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Seabed,85,Seabed is a luscious album that implores you to dive into the gorgeous depths of its sound and atmosphere.
Splendid,"Not Them, You",90,"Not Them, You brims with all the bravado and swagger that its title suggests."
Splendid,Once Upon A Little Time,80,"He barely sings above conversational volume -- a little bit raspy, rife with emotion and completely convincing. It's a perfect fit for his songs, and for the half-broken but lovely and endearing production style with which he has realized them."
Splendid,Takk...,90,"Their expanded sound, with its explosions of noise and romantic swells, deserves reconsideration by fans and skeptics alike."
Splendid,Loose In The Air,80,"The Double combine unsettling electronic noise with simple, enjoyable vocal hooks to create a rickety, rattletrap pop collage that's too undeniably ear-catching to ignore."
Splendid,The Weight Is A Gift,80,"Thankfully, the band's most endearing facets remain firmly intact -- namely, their timeless nature and complete disregard for the current musical zeitgeist."
Splendid,Plat du Jour,70,Plat du Jour is a more interesting an outing for remaining ambivalent in spite of itself.
Splendid,We're Animals,70,Some listeners may find the results to be a little bland for their tastes.
Splendid,Birds Make Good Neighbors,70,"These are love songs destined for indie purgatory -- the emotions are too real for corporate radio, the hooks too poppy for Indie 103."
Splendid,Broken Ear Record,50,"Although the group's previous outings routinely got bogged down in forced experimentalism, Broken Ear Record at least keeps the pace sufficiently frantic, which allows us to excuse some (if not all) of its more self-indulgent moments."
Splendid,Amber Headlights,70,"For a fractured album that spent several years in limbo, Amber Headlights does two things very well: it's an impressive introduction to Dulli's far-reaching musical talent, and a spiritual cleansing for the wry vocalist himself."
Splendid,The Invisible Invasion,60,"Outstanding production, clever lyrics and catchy melodies should add up to the sort of record capable of making a serious splash. Unfortunately, Invisible Invasion demonstrates an unwavering adherence to established musical traditions."
Splendid,Menos el Oso,40,"They hit all the right notes and create the right hooks for success, at least in theory, but for all the passion in Jake Snider's voice, he might as well be singing about the ham sandwich he ate for lunch."
Splendid,Twin Cinema,70,"It isn't identical to Mass Romantic or Electric Version, but it differs from them in ways that probably could have been predicted, modeled and simulated."
Splendid,Blitzkrieg Pop,80,"Many fans may be turned off by the abrupt shifts in pace and style, but engaged listening reveals an overarching sensibility that guides the project from beginning to end."
Splendid,Knitting Needles And Bicycle Bells,70,"Knitting Needles and Bicycle Bells is the sort of album you put on when you're in the mood for a particular sound -- and the sound in question is echoing and catchy, yet depressive."
Splendid,Pixel Revolt,80,"Vanderslice's stories differ from those on earlier albums largely in setting, but Pixel Revolt's musical elements have taken an astonishing leap from their predecessors."
Splendid,Year Of Meteors,80,"Year of Meteors isn't the sound of ground being broken; it's an artist growing ever more confident, but never overly comfortable, in her style."
Splendid,Surgery,70,"Surgery is quite an impressive effort, sporting just the right combination of nods to their influences and carefully balanced instrumental execution."
Splendid,Quit +/or Fight,70,"Holopaw's delicate, subdued second album lacks their debut's sharp peaks and valleys."
Splendid,Less Than Human,80,"A dance record for people who never leave their apartments, a rock record for the rave set, Less Than Human is the sound of people high on energy and sweat."
Splendid,Spelled In Bones,90,Saying that the man knows his way around a hook is an understatement: he throws hooks around like an incandescent bulb does photons.
Splendid,Body Of Song,80,Body of Song is a record that plays like a book.
Splendid,Honeycomb,70,Honeycomb isn't a great album -- it's too tentative and self-restrained for that -- but it's quite a good one.
Splendid,Alpine Static,90,"It highlights their talent for finding the core of invention within repetition, and suggests far greater peaks (and much greener valleys) in their future."
No Ripcord,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,70,"Her sound is a junksale of clutter and certified gems. I can feel youŠ—_ is her most sonically sharp weapon to date, and full of plenty to get excited about if you rifle through it."
No Ripcord,Could It Be Different?,70,"But outside of their reminiscences about troubled adolescence, which sometimes provide a gratingly innocent tone, How Could it Be Any Different? is otherwise brimful with lighthearted, yet meaningful songs that could actually make a difference."
No Ripcord,The  Official Body,50,"Repetition is considered their weakest strength, which isn't true at all--they introduce shrill synth textures and dub elements with a good understanding of technique. It does add the slightest variation to their acerbic post-punk, all rendered with a cheerful stance even if there's an apparent loss of rage. Still, this party feels less exciting than the night before."
No Ripcord,This Is Glue,70,"Their attempts at country-folk are less remarkable, causing This is Glue to droop towards its middle half, but Salad Boys do pick themselves up with aplomb rather than surrender to their sullen demeanor."
No Ripcord,A Day With The Homies [EP],70,"There have always been shadows cast from the overriding ebullience of Lennox's work as Panda Bear, but with A Day With the Homies, the shadows are confined by a skyscraping sun, where elastic psychedelic bungees in and out of the surf and basks in its feverish gleam."
No Ripcord,Snares Like a Haircut,80,"Their call-and-response breakdowns are still as impassioned as ever on tracks like Drippy and Cruise Control, where they place the hooks and melodies right on the surface. The use of ambiance over their riotous songs isn't just an asset, it's also the essence of No Age."
No Ripcord,Semicircle,40,"The nostalgia lacks anything close to the authenticity that Thunder, Lightning, Strike achieved, and the sound of the 2018 version of The Go! Team struggles to get anywhere far from persistent annoyance."
No Ripcord,Ruins,60,"Ruins is an affecting, comforting listen, but not one that will imprint itself too vividly in the memory."
No Ripcord,Marble Skies,60,"Ultimately, Marble Skies is a hopscotch of metamorphosizing sounds that can be rewarding for the most part, but only if you can muster the energy to make it so."
No Ripcord,The Thread That Keeps Us,70,"There's more of an improvisational focus to a lot of Thread, where they take on themes such as immigration policy and ecological concerns with their usual storytelling flair. It does have a familiar, intuitive touch; this is Calexico, after all. But the duo never does things with little effort or care."
No Ripcord,Rock Island,60,"Palm do stand out from their contemporaries on Rock Island, especially since they equally embrace and rile against indie rock as a conservative movement. Their nonconformist aesthetic is imbued with an independent spirit, even if the sources they pull from prevents them from really taking off."
No Ripcord,Microshift,90,Microshift clearly demonstrates that Hookworms are operating on a new level.
No Ripcord,Transangelic Exodus,90,"With Furman already establishing a consistent sound over his previous records, it was perhaps expected of him to cover some well-worn ground again here. Instead, and appropriately, Transangelic Exodus is an album that constantly takes left turns and refuses to slow. It turns out that with the right driver, there are plenty of miles left on the old road yet"
No Ripcord,Open Here,80,"With Open Here, Field Music sound like they're not only investing in their stability but in their future as well."
No Ripcord,Wrong Creatures,60,"Wrong Creatures is an impeccably produced record that will undoubtedly appeal to any devout Black Rebel Motorcycle Club listener. Every charging, hard rock guitar and squelching feedback strikes with a sharpness that does not come at the price of distortion. Still, the marked contrasts in Creatures give the impression that Black Rebel Motorcycle Club were aiming for a sweeping, meticulously-layered force of Be Here Now-like proportions."
No Ripcord,From the Fires,20,"They're playing the blues, man, and obviously, nobody does that anymore. And really, even on a good half of From the Fires, the fast-tracked major label signees don't even try to really emulate their esteemed deities' dangerous sexuality and, instead, bafflingly resort to half-assed emotional platitudes."
No Ripcord,QTY,70,"Their blueprint is a simple one, and QTY pull it off by being airtight from beginning to end, while the production work of Suede guitarist Bernard Butler seasons the deliciously retro sound perfectly"
No Ripcord,Weighing of the Heart,80,"The record manages to sound venturous and recklessly current. Iqbal's use of chiming guitars, serendipitous synths and scurrying beats results in a record that is opulent in its warmth and sparklingly neat."
No Ripcord,Post Self,80,"Simply put, Post Self is another stunning addition to Godflesh's uncompromising thirty-year run."
No Ripcord,Phantom Brickworks,80,"Entrancing in its stillness, Phantom Brickworks solidifies Bibio as an artist of remarkable versatility."
No Ripcord,Songs of Experience,70,"They embrace what they do best: creating music that balances this personal and political darkness with joy. In their strongest outing since All That You Can't Leave Behind, the four-piece writes both sweeping anthems as well as some of the most effortless songs of their career."
No Ripcord,Utopia,70,"Utopia does function as a companion piece to Vulnicura, if only because it doesn't require much effort to separate them as contrary forces."
No Ripcord,Plunge,80,"The electronic work is fantastic throughout Plunge, never adhering to presets and making full use of every beat, burst and throb. When coupled with Dreijer's slick, razor-sharp vocal you have a monster of a record that gets more impressive with every listen."
No Ripcord,Pacific Daydream,50,"Much of the album's electro-lite flavoring does provide some hummable moments, but as the cringingly tricked out Mexican Fender and stomping chants of La Mancha Screwjob suggest, they're most likely to suffer a slow and gradual death at your local Forever 21."
No Ripcord,Nothing Valley,70,"Nothing Valley is an intense, hugely engaging listen."
No Ripcord,III,70,"What Makthaverskan lack in variety they make up with a passion that cannot be quenched, and the dreamy undercurrent it carries throughout is filled with a shot of optimism that is undoubtedly contagious."
No Ripcord,Glasshouse,50,"The third LP from Jessie Ware sees her bring her diva mode to the forefront of her sound, but the lack of the scarcity and minimalism that saw her emerge at the turn of the decade results in the finished product lacking the effectiveness of her earlier work."
No Ripcord,"A  Flame My Love, a Frequency",80,"The open spaces she works with are stunningly evocative, but her compositions are no less busy, a testament to how she's based much of her compositional framework on a song's underlying rhythms. It provides a strong feeling of familiarity for those who've followed Colleen's work throughout the years."
No Ripcord,Reaching for Indigo,80,"Fohr details her cathartic experience with a smothering array of droning textures and clashing orchestral elements, where she succeeds at making sense out of her cosmic encounter."
No Ripcord,Losing,80,"Her ability on both sides of the mixing deck is on full display throughout Losing, and her latest work strengthens her case as a supremely talented songwriter and producer."
The Quietus,Painted Ruins,80,"While perhaps coming up slightly short on the nuanced splendor of Shields and the instantaneous ’©lan of its Veckatimest, Painted Ruins is a special kind of conquest. Be it via the unseen sparks that spring forth from heartbreak or the dizzying urges that stem from one too many late-night wrangling with one's place in the world, this is music stemming from a place that few artists can access."
The Quietus,Music for People in Trouble,80,"She turns experience into art with a painter's eye and a warrior's heart, and Music For People In Trouble is a profoundly humanist work: her finest by some distance."
The Quietus,Every Country's Sun,80,"This refinement in Mogwai's modus operandi suits them well. Where once their revolutionary sound startled, their evolutionary execution now beguiles--and keeps them several steps ahead of the pack."
The Quietus,"The Road, Vol. 1",70,"There's a passionate, earnest vibe that spills out to fill any cracks in quality, a window into Lavelle's soul that somehow opens wider whenever someone else takes the microphone."
The Quietus,Terminal,90,"Circle have reached many great heights over the last two decades, but this new album again attains a new zenith."
The Quietus,Paranormal,40,"While they're [Genuine American Girl and You And All Of Your Friends] two of the album's best songs, they, like the previous ten tracks, suffer from not just overproduction and out-of-date musical aesthetics, but also a half-hearted attempt to assert something pure about the rock of yore."
The Quietus,To the Bone,50,"To The Bone exposes and splinters insular communities and their ideas of elitism. But by observing the album through this prism alone, its real nature is obscured--that of a flawed and powerless homage."
The Quietus,Lack,80,"Across spheres of contemporary art, experimental music, noise and techno, Pan's twisting trajectory as an artist is rousing to witness; Lack_Û__ç serves as yet another reminder of her thrill."
The Quietus,Esker,80,"There is a shadowy enigma within Esker that verges on the blissful, thanks to its peculiar melodic turns and idiosyncratic use of sonic effects."
The Quietus,Silhouettes and Statues: A Gothic Revolution 1978-1986 [Box Set],70,"Not everything is suddenly revelatory in a positive sense--indeed, often the selections confirm exactly what you might expect, and sometimes songs start to blend into one another, which is inevitable over the course of such an extensive set."
The Quietus,Orc,80,"The best part about it is the Oh Sees manages to make this shift while still sounding like themselves, holding true with some killer bursts of distorted guitar and psychedelic reverb throughout."
The Quietus,TFCF,70,"TFCF is undoubtedly a record for recalibrating Andrew's personal and sonic compass but, rather thrillingly, suggests that despite the realignment, great things lie in the future."
The Quietus,Fresh Air,80,This is perhaps Faust's most solid and coherent body of work since their 1990s resurrection. It roars with sadness and anger at a world's squandered opportunities.
The Quietus,Beast Epic,80,"This record is snug, unthreatening and comforting, which means anyone looking for rage and catharsis ought to give it a wide berth. But for many of those preoccupied by the kind of concerns that trouble Sam Beam--chiefly thoughts of mortality and fallibility--Beast Epic will be a long, warm, healing embrace."
The Quietus,Mogoya,80,"Sangare sounds energised by the new production context: the new sound becomes her, and as one would expect it is her power, verve and versatility that truly carry the album. [Jun 2017, p.70]"
The Quietus,New Facts Emerge,90,A superb record--sharp and absolutely dangerous.
The Quietus,Bright Phoebus [Reissue],90,"While not an unqualified success, particularly in its sequencing, the overwhelming majority of Bright Phoebus warrants every ounce of the reputation the record has spawned during its absence from the world at large. Where it sags, it recovers quickly, and where it rises, it rides upon thermal after thermal, scornful of gravity."
The Quietus,Rembo,80,"The majority of the tracks on the album are put together in such a way as to make you want to dance as well as take you on a journey, and by the third listen in you really begin to find yourself immersed."
The Quietus,The Underside of Power,80,"The Underside of Power is both the latest chapter in a long-running and universal story that seems to be nearing climax, and solid, sonic proof that Algiers are capable of not just acting with their hearts, but ripping them out and offering them up on record."
The Quietus,It,80,His finest work since the first two Suicide LPs.
The Quietus,I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone,80,"There is joy here, beyond the pleasure of wallowing so elegantly and tunefully in ennui."
The Quietus,Also Sprach Zarathustra,90,"Laibach seize every opportunity on Also Sprach Zarathustra to bring out the grandiose psychodrama and tension inherent in a founding tract of modern philosophy, rendering what could have been merely bombastic and brutal as spectacular and even sublime. It might not be greatest present that has ever been made to humanity, but it is a resoundingly impressive feat."
The Quietus,Dear,80,"Dear could have been the end of the trip. But a quarter of a century in, Boris remain alert at the controls as they pilot their craft into uncharted galaxies, boldly going where no group has gone before."
The Quietus,A Short History of Decay,80,"A Short History Of Decay is raw, honest and painful: listening to its 10 songs feels like intruding on someone's personal grief."
The Quietus,Blast Off Through the Wicker,80,It is a record that inverts and internalises its inspirations rather than externalising and projecting them. It's delicious. Try it.
The Quietus,Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star,50,"The album is by no means horrible, just disappointing and repetitive, chock full of revamped old school rhythms that don't have the gratifying content to match. A good handful of songs--'When Cats Claw', 'Since C.A.Y.A', 'Fine Ass Hairdresser', 'Julian's Dream', 'Moon Whip Qu’_z' and '30 Clip Extension'--deserve to be judged independently."
The Quietus,Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines,50,"The album is by no means horrible, just disappointing and repetitive, chock full of revamped old school rhythms that don't have the gratifying content to match. A good handful of songs--'When Cats Claw', 'Since C.A.Y.A', 'Fine Ass Hairdresser', 'Julian's Dream', 'Moon Whip Qu’_z' and '30 Clip Extension'--deserve to be judged independently."
The Quietus,Fabriclive 93,70,"Due to Snaith's decision to make music in situ, FabricLive 93 tends to veer and swerve all over the place in terms of a 'narrative'. ... You can hear that Snaith is clearly having fun letting his instincts take him where he feels the music needs to go. This rubs off on the mix--you do find yourself propelled by the energy, despite the missteps made on the way."
The Quietus,Lifetime of Love,80,"Lifetime of Love is a strange album, where songs with differing emotional foundations, sonic palettes, aural pace and textural aesthetics mesh into a cohesive whole. As Moon Diagrams, Archuleta has created a world where introspection, catharsis and redemption can envelop you and become something porous, to be inhaled and lived in."
The Quietus,A Walk With Love and Death,70,"The tenacity and productivity of the Melvins is admirable, as is their ability to continue to push music into some of its darkest and most intriguing corners. What would be really interesting, though, is if the Melvins made fewer Melvins records and tried more projects like the one on the second half of A Walk With Love & Death. After 34 years, their output is at times just a little too breathless."
The A.V. Club,Dedicated to Bobby Jameson,83,"Dedicated To Bobby Jameson is the most comfortable Pink's ever sounded with his own success, turning legitimacy into a noble weapon: ambition."
The A.V. Club,Half-Light,83,"Half-Light is never less than interesting: It's tremendously layered and fussy, but also sweet and light. It's a hell of a start for a guy who's been doing it forever."
The A.V. Club,"Deer Tick, Vol. 1",83,The first half of this Jekyll and Hyde act showcases the kind of skillful songwriters and musicians Deer Tick have grown into. The 10 tracks cover a lot of ground.
The A.V. Club,"Deer Tick, Vol. 2",75,"For all the noticeable gains Deer Tick has made in its songwriting in recent years, Vol. 2 offers sufficient proof that it hasn't lost its raw nerve."
The A.V. Club,Prophets of Rage,25,"It is an album of obvious statements set to equally thudding music, liable to move and inspire no one."
The A.V. Club,Try Not To Freak Out,75,"As a whole, Try Not To Freak Out is a joyful blast, a John Hughes soundtrack on steroids that never loses its sunny disposition."
The A.V. Club,Native Invader,83,"Native Invader isn't as confrontational as Amos' early work, and as a result, once or twice the album takes a brief detour into coffeeshop clich’©. But even the sillier lyrical content is elevated by Amos' talent for arrangement and distinctive snippets of melody."
The A.V. Club,L.A Witch,83,"On their debut, the three weird sisters in L.A. Witch have conjured up a sexy, enigmatic album that looks forward by looking back."
The A.V. Club,Parallels,83,"For all its probity, Parallels is of a piece with its predecessors, another curvilinear and sinuous 30-minute odyssey from one of the most consistent and daring producers working."
The A.V. Club,The Hanged Man,83,"This seven-year stretch has obviously been both reinvigorating and emotionally devastating for Leo. Fortunately, he's channeled all that grief, anger, and inspiration into another 14 tracks packed with commentary and experimentation."
The A.V. Club,Love What Survives,75,"It's uniformly pleasurable, occasionally stirring listening, and Campos and Maker have excellent taste."
The A.V. Club,Mountain Moves,75,"If Mountain Moves occasionally feels disconnected, it's because the theme upon which it hinges--injustice--is, sadly, still as broadly defined as it gets. Fortunately, that disconnectedness makes for a bright, lively listen."
The A.V. Club,Antisocialites,83,"Rather than clashing, those two halves--one romantic and aspirational, one blunt and realistic--sharpen each other and create an album that delivers, and then some, on the promise of the band's self-titled debut."
The A.V. Club,Okovi,91,"Zola's latest, Okovi, is more homecoming than course correction."
The A.V. Club,Sleep Well Beast,100,"Those invested in the band's slow-motion refinement of simmering melancholy will find that they've discovered yet more fresh nuance to that sound, as they seem to every time."
The A.V. Club,Expect the Best,75,"On Expect The Best, Widowspeak returns to the looseness of its earlier output but drops even more of its guard, and the band's ever-present nostalgia becomes a deeper autobiographical commentary on the passage of time and expectations."
The A.V. Club,The Punishment of Luxury,83,"In the wrong hands, this kind of thing could come across as heavy-handed or detached, but The Punishment Of Luxury exudes warmth and empathy throughout."
The A.V. Club,Every Country's Sun,83,Despite the odd misstep--like the distant minimalism of '1000 Foot Face'--the album soars with a vibrancy that sustains it over its nearly hourlong running time.
The A.V. Club,American Dream,91,"It's a beautifully produced, masterfully realized album, but it's also a bit of a downer and an unusually slow burn."
The A.V. Club,Who Told You To Think?,83,"Milo's still firmly making experimental hip-hop, bridging various through-lines of mind-expanding boom-bap, but he's also etching his way toward the center, his art getting clearer with each step."
The A.V. Club,Villains,75,"On the whole, Villains isn't Homme's strongest collection of songwriting. That said, it's the first Queens Of The Stone Age album where the sounds behind it are consistently strong enough to carry the load."
The A.V. Club,Invitation,75,"Invitation is strong enough as a whole to breeze past those weaker moments. Filthy Friends' debut provides exactly what their lineage promises, and when it comes to supergroups, that amounts to coming out ahead."
The A.V. Club,Holiday Destination,83,"On her third LP, Shah displays the patience to let an idea stew. And she's not moving on until she's sufficiently chewed it over, swished it around her mouth, and dragged her tongue across her front teeth."
The A.V. Club,A Deeper Understanding,91,"With much higher expectations weighing on the band, it's produced a successor that shines up and builds on that breakthrough in every way."
The A.V. Club,Exile in the Outer Ring,83,"Dread surrounds Exile In The Outer Ring like a thick fog. As much as EMA empathizes with 'the kids from the void,' her excellent album offers little comfort besides the gentle urging of 'Hey, don't go away' ('Down And Out')."
The A.V. Club,Orc,83,It's a good balance of moods and sounds--a welcome trot from a band more inclined to sprint.
The A.V. Club,Beast Epic,100,Beast Epic perfectly distills a career into a nearly perfect collection.
The A.V. Club,Science Fiction,83,"Brand New has put in the work, making a record that erases any doubts about whether the final product would live up to eight years of mystery and hype. And it's effectively erased its past by making good on every far-flung expectation placed upon it."
The A.V. Club,Painted Ruins,91,"In all, Painted Ruins represents the band's strongest compositions since Yellow House--and still, there's something weirdly revolutionary about this kind of formalism in 2017."
The A.V. Club,Warmth,75,"Taken all together, Warmth is an enveloping listen, whether you're the type to get up and move to music, or just sit and overthink it."
E! Online,St. Elsewhere,100,"Weird, wonderful and, yes, super."
E! Online,Living With War,75,"The reactionary disc is a step up from 2003's similarly political offering, Greendale, largely because it doesn't come disguised as some community-theater production."
E! Online,Springtime Can Kill You,100,"On bluesy new tracks such as ""Stubborn Beast"" and ""Moonshiner,"" she conjures a sensual, serious confidence that suggests she's ready to depose Cat Power as the queen of indie teardrop ballads."
E! Online,Stadium Arcadium,75,The whole thing seems like a guided tour through the band's different incarnations.
E! Online,Surprise,83,"In a meeting of the minds, the folk hero and the electronic-music guru produce an unexpectedly listenable collection of songs that doesn't really compromise either of their styles."
E! Online,Eyes Open,75,The band's naked ambition would be offputting if it didn't come wrapped in such resounding choruses.
E! Online,Goodbye Alice In Wonderland,67,"Unfortunately, Jewel... chooses to revert to the soppy musical formula of her 1995 debut, Pieces of You."
E! Online,Blood Money,42,"The duo's seventh album sees an invasion of unnecessary guest stars, such as Lloyd Banks and Yayo, and a disappointing lyrical turn that celebrates monotonous Detroit staples like guns, cash and bumps."
E! Online,Pearl Jam,75,"Songs like ""World Wide Suicide"" and ""Severed Head"" even come close to recreating the hard rock thrills of the band's billion-selling debut, Ten."
E! Online,"10,000 Days",75,Sounds exactly like you would expect a Tool album to sound.
E! Online,Wolfmother,67,The surprising thing about this retro rock trio is that it can actually rock.
E! Online,The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living,75,"Critics called it lazy, self-indulgent and amateurish--as if its predecessors somehow resembled Dark Side of the Moon. The truth is, this sounds exactly like Skinner's last two Brit Award-winning and Mercury Prize-nominated discs."
E! Online,We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,100,It's quite possibly his best album since 1982's Nebraska.
E! Online,Pick A Bigger Weapon,75,As lyrically inflammatory as ever.
E! Online,All The Roadrunning,67,"For a better taste of Harris' harmonizing abilities, try her recent collaborations with young'uns like Bright Eyes and Ryan Adams."
E! Online,A Blessing And A Curse,83,It's the kind of album that finds its own cozy place somewhere between Lynyrd Skynyrd and Leonard Cohen.
E! Online,Under The Covers Vol. 1,83,Fun and fascinating.
E! Online,You In Reverse,83,"An album that does his low-key legacy well, mixing classic rock-influenced guitar solos and quaint folk sounds with psychedelic effects and high-pitched melodies that put Rush's Geddy Lee to shame."
E! Online,Death By Sexy,75,Essential? Not really. Fun as hell? Definitely.
E! Online,White Trash With Money,25,He doesn't deliver much you haven't heard before.
E! Online,Todd Smith,67,"In the end, even LL himself seems a little lost in his efforts to find Todd Smith."
E! Online,Daniel Powter,75,A self-titled debut album steeped in beautiful but bland lovelorn ballads that tip a wool cap to vintage Elton John.
E! Online,At War With The Mystics,100,Tak[es] on the state of global affairs in a way that is both surprisingly direct yet somehow reassuringly weird.
E! Online,Ringleader Of The Tormentors,83,"These tunes find him not only reconnecting with his sense of melodic urgency but with his loins, as well."
E! Online,I'm Not Dead,67,The only sign of life is that filthy mouth and cherry-vanilla hair.
E! Online,Vision Valley,83,The band's recovery on Vision Valley is nothing short of remarkable.
E! Online,The Loon,50,"[A] thoroughly underwhelming debut, an album that merely paints within the lines already drawn by Pavement and the Pixies."
E! Online,Show Your Bones,91,"The group cuts through style in pursuit of substance, using Fever to Tell's slow-burning hit ""Maps"" as a jump-off point."
E! Online,King,83,"The disc is all over the map, moving from booming dance cuts to gangsta fare, but it satisfies with crunk-tacular gems like ""What You Know."""
E! Online,The Back Room,91,The Back Room is a fine album that proves you can look backward while paving the way forward.
CMJ,Wooden Head,70,"A solid, ambling around, summer daytime soundtrack, rather than the numerous nighttime ruminators we've already been frequently offered this year."
CMJ,Can't Love,70,Can't Love is a sonic semblance of moving from a bustling warehouse in gentrifying Brooklyn to wandering around alone on a culdesac in the rust belt and wondering what the next stage is.
CMJ,We Are Only What We Feel,40,"NONONO are Swedish afterall, so while uneclectic, the album is not without its well executed, catchy genre charms. But what NONONO does well on We Are Only What We Feel, other people have done better time and time again."
CMJ,Careers,80,"Although most of Careers chugs along with a sandy roadside candor, some tracks, like the churning, heavy Planet Birthday or the clinically pulsing Hong Kong Hotel, play with disparate textures."
CMJ,Liberation!,70,"Liberation! may not achieve its loftiest goals, but Bauer does manage to launch his solo career with talent and class."
CMJ,Neon Icon,60,"Neon Icon is the weight the internet has left us with. It's a much-delayed product of Tumblr art, Big Brother reality TV, corporate worship and urban fetishism. Or, maybe it's pushing against these things. I dunno, whatever, at least it's pretty fun."
CMJ,PHOX,80,"By existing at their own preferred pace, PHOX's wonderful inability to conform to anyone else's standards is what forces listeners to slowly digest their subtly multi-layered sounds. PHOX may be self-sufficient enough to do without your love, but it certainly deserves it."
CMJ,Tropics of Love,50,"Tropics Of Love is an experiment in inertia. When it's good, it stays good, and when it's not, it'll be over by the time you swallow your pina colada."
CMJ,Familiars,80,Familiars' ultimately succeeds in delivering the third consecutive full-length gem from the Antlers.
CMJ,Favorite Waitress,80,"It's a cracked, smart and surprisingly powerful album, you just have to listen a bit closer than usual to hear what it's trying to say."
CMJ,In the Lonely Hour,60,"When Smith gets a little feistier (his last resort), the songs feel more ambitious; but it's the more minimal, quiet ones that hit home emotionally."
CMJ,Seek Warmer Climes,70,"The band demonstrates its growth from angst-driven punks to thematic artists (although still retaining enough angst) by having developed and refined their musical style, as well as further grasped the emotions that are intertwined within the songs' depths."
CMJ,Stay Gold,80,"There doesn't appear to be much room for hope, but they execute their sadness so beautifully that it's easy to accept their blue moods."
CMJ,Lazaretto,60,"The music is smart, diverse and tuned to perfectionist standards, but frequently the lyrics leave the listener wondering, 'Where is White's gut on this?'"
CMJ,House of Spirits,50,"Where Tim Cohen's vocals should soar, scream or sink low, they remain at a consistent monotone, rendering his occasionally poetic lyrics into lukewarm sentiments that do not invite further investigation."
CMJ,Nausea,70,"The evolution is slight but impressive, and worth taking note of."
CMJ,Dalliance,70,"Despite some sugary moments, Dalliance, mostly ringing with fizzy excitement, is nonetheless a record that toes the line between bitter and sweet lonely dude moments."
CMJ,Sunbathing Animal,70,"Mainly, the band locks into grooves and reigns in some of the cackle of earlier releases, while wisely drunk-dancing in the under-four-minute mode."
CMJ,Glass Boys,70,"It cannot be denied that this album can't help but fall short of the previous two records' effect, given the massive quantity of pioneering moves captured in those albums. Nonetheless, whether or not Fucked Up can see it, they're still doing the music world some good."
CMJ,Are We There,80,"Written and recorded herself, Are We There, her fourth full-length, is a Sharon Van Etten record through-and-through."
CMJ,In Conflict,80,"Pallett's vocals that move from soft quiver to full tenor on the title track. And when paired with his simple pop tendencies, the intricacies are easy to absorb. All you have to do is listen."
CMJ,The Moon Rang Like a Bell,70,The Moon Rang Like A Bell is both subtly understated and completely overstated.
CMJ,Hour of the Dawn,70,"Taken as it is, this is a great summer's coming album, the most fresh guitar pop record of the year, though it might be a bit too bright at times."
CMJ,Dark Arc,80,"Dark Arc's unique sound is a team effort of acoustic instruments, raw talent and the life that comes from breathing the fresh, crisp, if sometimes foggy mountain air."
CMJ,Ultima II Massage,70,"Not exactly a massage, but a wind-down from the tumult that is Ultima II Massage."
CMJ,III,80,III is an album so methodically arranged yet lawless at times that even its more flatlined moments play an integral role in its rebellion.
CMJ,I Never Learn,80,"Every track on this album is relatable and takes us on an emotional journey through the steps of a breakup, which in Li's interpretation seems to be frustration, pain and ultimately loneliness."
CMJ,Christmas Island,70,"While the lyrics have always been one of the main highlights of every AJJ album, the ridiculous level of the lyrics on this one might stretch the tolerance of even the most dedicated fans."
CMJ,Nikki Nack,80,"At certain points in Nikki Nack, like the track Manchild, her quirkiness feels out of reach, but it always comes back down again to teach you a little something about life, love and letting creativity shine through."
CMJ,Arcadia,80,"What makes Arcadia stand on its own is the slight, simplistic tweaks and unexpected syncopation that Polachek uses to infuse the album with an almost apocalyptic sense of silliness and childish wonder. It's exciting to listen to, but at the same time vaguely unsettling."
Exclaim,DJ-Kicks,70,"Lone's take on DJ-Kicks nails it right out of the gate, but starts to lose its eclectic melange as it pushes forward, swapping out the nuanced front half of the album with bland cut-outs that vary too little."
Exclaim,Belief System,70,Belief System should clearly have been released as two separate albums; one that's a candidate for album of the year and one that's completely forgettable.
Exclaim,Out of Range,80,"Throughout the album's 11 tracks and over 42 minutes of music, the quartet manage to brood their way through numerous artistic themes, from Bruegel the Elder to Samuel Beckett, running each through a Western American scope."
Exclaim,Joli Mai,80,"The consistency here comes in the form of non-stop, solid tracks; there isn't a bad recording on this whole album, which is no easy feat."
Exclaim,American Fall,80,"The band still know how to write a good ""whoa-oh,"" and their message has been sharpened by outside factors, making it seem more vital than ever. Anti-Flag haven't changed; the world has."
Exclaim,Phantom Brickworks,60,"Wilkinson's eighth full-length shows the musician's adeptness at thoughtful, patient compositions, but he seems to have forgotten the value of self-editing."
Exclaim,World Wide Funk,70,"World Wide Funk doesn't break any new ground, but it showcases Bootsy Collins blissfully stretching out."
Exclaim,The Dusk in Us,80,"The Dusk in Us is another step forward for Converge, pushing their sound to new levels in a way that is uniquely their own. Although it took five years to come to fruition, the record was well worth the wait, and stands as a testament to why the band have become so hugely influential."
Exclaim,Anthology: Movie Themes 1974-1998,80,"Anthology: Movie Themes 1974-1998 is a fine introduction to John Carpenter the musician for newbies, and a welcome re-visit for longtime fans."
Exclaim,The New Monday,80,"This LP captures Shigeto's embracing of myriad sounds, styles and sensibilities, and while his original sound still shines through, he shows the listener that diving into new territory can have massive payoffs."
Exclaim,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,80,"There are plenty of other highlights to be raved about in 4eva Is a Mighty Long Time's massive tracklist. Do yourself a favour: pick up this LP and immerse yourself not only in its impressive breadth, but also its practically unparalleled depth."
Exclaim,Rat Film [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack],60,"As a standalone release, devoid of the visual context it's designed to pair with, Rat Film doesn't always find lasting purchase, but it does in parts. ... Still, Rat Film shows off increasing nuance and range in Deacon's abilities as a composer."
Exclaim,"The Lonely, The Lonesome & The Gone",50,"Her move away from pop music  on The Lonely, The Lonesome & The Gone signals a deeper understanding of the country, blues and soul genres, but there aren't enough ideas here to make it succeed."
Exclaim,The Wild,80,"Though highly unlikely to unseat Hometowns or Departing as fan favourites, The Wild follows in the footsteps of the band's previous album, Mended with Gold, as a very strong album that doesn't yet hold the same sentimental value as their earlier material."
Exclaim,"A  Flame My Love, a Frequency",80,"Colleen continues to craft uniquely personal experimental music with a clear artistic voice, and her latest release might be her greatest achievement yet."
Exclaim,Screen Memories,90,"Like Maus's best work, Screen Memories converses primarily through its musical and instrumental affect. These songs are so clearly laboured over and full of detail that their impact as a whole, coupled with bizarre and often-obfuscated lyrics, can easily wash over a first-time listener. Spend some time immersed in their depths, though, and watch as they unravel and fill in Maus's immaculate vocal sketches."
Exclaim,Sab Se Purani Bab,70,"Bizarrely infectious and never dull, this album of anarchistic yet spiritually reverent psychedelic experimental ragas is well worth checking out."
Exclaim,Laila's Wisdom,90,"It's not only her best work, but the best amongst her peers, the sort of album that transcends the lane she was in beforehand, transcends whatever antiquated gender biases may still permeate the genre and puts her in the same category as your favourite rapper (who's now clamouring for a Rapsody feature)."
Exclaim,Turn Out the Lights,90,"Baker is careful not to glorify life's darkest moments, and certainly doesn't on Turn Out the Lights. Rather, her candid portrayal of pain is a rare and beautiful gift."
Exclaim,Pacific Daydream,30,"Weezer have had their share of ups and downs over the years, but Pacific Daydream finds them at their most clunky yet."
Exclaim,Any Other Way,80,"Uptempo or down, Shane's performances were maximum R&B before the term was coined."
Exclaim,Mirror Reaper,80,Mirror Reaper is certainly an outstanding accomplishment in the Bell Witch catalogue. It may be their most emotionally stirring and musically ambitious record to date.
Exclaim,The  Blood of Gods,60,"Longtime fans of Gwar will surely find a track here and there that's worthwhile, but in general, they would be better off returning to their back catalogue."
Exclaim,Backwater,70,"Backwater is a mature, rich effort that's likely to see Kllo continue on their ascent."
Exclaim,Mnestic Pressure,80,"Mnestic Pressure feels like a synthesis of electronic music's best bits woven together in an intricate pattern, expertly, as very few producers can."
Exclaim,Ken,80,"With ken, he has once again delivered an excellent record that offers both sonic surprises and familiar idiosyncrasies."
Exclaim,This Sweet Old World,70,"Lucinda Williams is an artist with the confidence to say what needs to be said, and the power to back it up. On This Sweet Old World, she might be repeating the words, but she's hardly repeating herself."
Exclaim,All American Made,90,"All American Made is provocative, charismatic and endearing, proving what many of country's all-time greats already seem to know: Margo Price is a legend in the making."
Exclaim,It's Alright Between Us as It Is,60,"It's frankly still a pleasure to hear Lindstr’Ùm masterfully keep everything in check, but there's a distinct lack of the full-throttle joyousness that he's capable of. If it was his intentional choice to temper that instinct, it was sadly misjudged."
Exclaim,The Ooz,80,"The OOZ also practices an astonishingly brilliant economy of sound, allowing only the most needed instrumentation to percolate to the surface, emanating and radiating: nothing is overblown; everything is necessary."
Pitchfork,Hesaitix,76,"Rooted somewhere in the corporeal fantasies that have always propelled dance music, Hesaitix unravels an imaginary realm that feels genuinely new in form."
Pitchfork,"Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho",63,Huncho Jack's liveliness tends to come from everywhere except Quavo and Travis Scott. The protean energy that buoy their respective works are sadly absent.
Pitchfork,Tommy [EP],76,"While she may borrow from R&B and pop, Klein's output has more in common with the abstract impressionism of Jackson Pollock. Such intensity makes Tommy a difficult and even exhausting listen, despite a running time of just 25 minutes. But as Captain Beefheart and the Shaggs have shown in the past--and as Klein demonstrates nowŠ—”-stepping off the musical path that leads to standardized perfection can prove hugely rewarding."
Pitchfork,Ardor,76,"Ardor ultimately feels emotionally coherent but tricky to categorize. BIG|BRAVE are the sound of the raw unconscious, turned up loud."
Pitchfork,The Emancipation Procrastination,76,"After two releases filled with high-concept fusion, some listeners might be hungry for solos that hang around longer and aren't so beholden to the mood of the production. Adjuah delivers exactly this on The Emancipation Procrastination."
Pitchfork,Super Slimey [Mixtape],71,"Neither Future nor Thug is at the peak of his powers on Super Slimey, which forgoes explosiveness and poignancy for streamlined action, and many of the solo cuts shine brighter than the team-ups."
Pitchfork,Say Less,63,"Wood$ does an excellent job of creating a chilled-out vibe--the kind of music that could soundtrack any setting, whether it's time to club or wind down. That's a fine quality to have, but there's a sense that something deeper is tucked beneath the layers of his brand of trappy R&B."
Pitchfork,Pressure,63,Jeezy is mostly comfortable doing the same things he's always done and letting others take the leaps. But times are changing and Jeezy is still clearly struggling to adapt to them.
Pitchfork,Bonny Doon,74,"An album of sunlit melodies with the shadows of Detroit looming over it delivers more than expected; it's not easy creating a doleful aftertaste that never quite dampens spirits, but Bonny Doon pull it off."
Pitchfork,My House From All Angles,60,"It's full of capable floor-fillers, but it rarely offers listeners much they haven't heard many times before."
Pitchfork,The Beautiful & Damned,51,"There are no insights to be found here about prestige, depression, or dependency. The whole thing is unbelievably dour and boring."
Pitchfork,For Paris,77,"Both in the events leading up to this album and in the music contained within, Vincent has proven imperfect. That messiness comes to define this album, making for machine music that's lovingly flawed and human."
Pitchfork,Saturation III,75,"On Saturation III, the collective's objective begins to come into focus. They still paint in broad strokes and their songs sometimes still lack continuity, but they're truly moving as a unit now, and the star power is all but obvious."
Pitchfork,Polygondwanaland,72,"King Gizzard tend to get roped up in the flourishes on Polygondwanaland, before giving way to an instinctive simplicity. At times, it works to their advantage, like when they moderate the dynamics of a feverish tempo on 'Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet.' Elsewhere, the band dulls itself by overthinking a section and losing their knack for natural flow."
Pitchfork,Pop 2 [Mixtape],84,"It's not just the guest roster that sets Pop 2 so apart from the mainstream pop landscape, it's the way these voices are integrated, making its 10 tracks feel less like a cool-kid curation project and more like a popping afterparty you've stumbled into."
Pitchfork,Les Fleurs du Mal,76,"As ambient music, radio play, fetid sustenance for misanthropic shut-ins--it is a singular piece of work, and a bold step forward for Rabit's inky aesthetic."
Pitchfork,Revival,50,"While the long tracklist and equally protracted verses make for an exhausting listen, there are rewards for those that endure."
Pitchfork,Diggin in the Carts: A Collection Of Pioneering Japanese Video Game Music,75,Diggin' is a remarkable transmission: a document of a wave of heady creativity swept under our headlong rush toward tomorrow.
Pitchfork,Finding Shore,80,"Between their respective spotlight turns, both musicians are on equal footing, challenging and surprising one another, and their listeners, with music that feels alive and wondrous."
Pitchfork,No One Ever Really Dies,62,"The album's first half sounds relatively strong. ... But No_One Ever Really Dies runs into a wall midway through, as old ideas rear their heads like those nobbly-headed creatures in Whac-a-Mole."
Pitchfork,Box Set #4: Curated by Erykah Badu [Box Set],85,"Ultimately, Badu's reimagining of Fela succeeds better than any of the previous box sets by making his music feel both very much alive and very much her own. Her curation pulls together a sonically and thematically coherent experience that comes close to being the macro-album these album-length macro-grooves seem to demand."
Pitchfork,Tribute to 2,62,"If Eternally Even was James' aggrieved effort to engage directly with a world in unrest, Tribute To 2 is an attempt to offer succor. It's a little glimpse of the past James hopes will soothe and reassure us."
Pitchfork,Double Or Nothing,54,"From the quality of the production, it seems that Metro knows he wasn't going to get a progressive performance from Sean. Most of the beats on the album are standard fare with a few gems like 'Reason,' which recalls Metro's What a Time to Be Alive production 'Jumpman,' and 'Who's Stopping Me' which samples from Brazilian artist Nazar’© Pereira's 'Clar’£o De Lua,' something a little bit different from Metro's typically modern approach."
Pitchfork,Singles 1978-2016 [Box Set],84,"This is still a staggering monument all the same, an elaborately detailed portrait of a shambolic artist whose astonishing productivity, creative restlessness, and utter disdain for the niceties of civil society know no bounds."
Pitchfork,Improvisations,56,"For all the racket, there simply isn't enough focus, enough control, or enough music. Improvisations hints at the duo's potential but is a fundamentally insubstantial listen."
Pitchfork,Habibi Funk: An Eclectic Selection,76,"Fans of Sublime Frequencies and their exhaustive look at Southeast Asian bands taken by surf music will find kinship in 'Mirza' and the skronking sax lines of Sudanese track 'El Bomba.' And just when it seems the comp is firmly entrenched in an exploration of how '60s rock and R&B infiltrated the region, the tumbling disco beat and needling reeds make Mallek Mohamed's 'Rouhi Ya Hafida' refreshing."
Pitchfork,"From a Room, Vol. 2",73,"Vol. 2 leavens its heavier moments with songs that celebrate the simple joys of love and marriage and family, without lapsing into sentimentality."
Pitchfork,"How to Solve Our Human Problems, Pt. 1 [EP]",69,"How to Solve Our Human Problems, Part 1 is the sound of a band deploying its full arsenal of bells and whistles to seize your attention, even when the songs themselves aren't always strong enough to retain the grip."
Pitchfork,Rot,73,The band sell their introspection by marrying it to convincingly urgent music. It's also a lot of fun; all the flying guitar chords and thumping beats inevitably quicken pulses.
Pitchfork,Material Control,66,"They really leave no space for Palumbo, and while there are distinct choruses, there are no hooks. There are more memorable basslines than vocal melodies."
The 405,Outrage! Is Now,30,The band rarely have anything interesting to say.
The 405,Dedicated to Bobby Jameson,85,"Dedicated to Bobby Jameson picks up where the late Bobby Jameson left off, solidifying his name as an inspiration for one of the most impressive indie-rock records of the past decade."
The 405,Communicating,85,"Through their highly freeform but affectionate collaboration, the trio consistently accentuates the potency of the passion in the songs."
The 405,Native Invader,65,"Native Invader is a step back from Unrepentant Geraldines, but still boasts enough quality to suggest that she has another stellar album in her."
The 405,Forced Witness,75,"Cameron's reach for the stars will be a divisive listen. He pulls no punches in creating this character, and the ugly language used to do so, will be viewed as unnecessary by some. But it all hangs together pretty well to create a set of songs that largely transcend the lame pastiches that they can stray close to being."
The 405,Light Information,70,It's perfectly plausible that the record will age just as well as VanGaalen's best stuff--we just gotta give it more time to let its shapeshifting flowers bloom into something as beautiful as his animations.
The 405,Antisocialites,60,"At its best, Antisocialites is a raw effort from a band who swears they've been around longer than they have, composing a handful of very good songs, with a majority of flukey, bored-out-of-my-fucking-mind songs that seem to drag one after the other. Alvvays' main flaw remains their lack of authenticity, a tragedy for a band with this much potential."
The 405,Love What Survives,65,"We're left with many songs that could have used some voices, or ones where the voices dominate proceedings, taking the focus away from the creators."
The 405,Bicep,70,"The music as a whole isn't as immersive as you would expect it to feel at first. Instead it works on a more subconscious level, gradually drawing you in with a subtle pull. That seeming lack of immediacy does nothing to take away from how enjoyable many of the highlights here are, and the album is well-paced in such a way that it never lingers longer than it needs to."
The 405,L.A Witch,75,"It's short, powerful, and set to turn your insides out."
The 405,Sleep Well Beast,85,"It's the best National album since Boxer; and for argument's sake, Devendorf's drumming hasn't been this vital for ten years."
The 405,Forget,75,"It transmits a message in a coherent way and addresses social criticism of the current times, all of which places their new album among the year's unforgettable ones."
The 405,Music for People in Trouble,80,"Music For People in Trouble led Sundf’Ùr away from euphoria but, in its own way, also gave her the tools to find herself again in music. Ultimately this directed her down path, through singing in the purest of forms and composing, to finding tenderness in love and matters of the heart."
The 405,Omnion,85,"This is music that can offer everything, but demands nothing. That's no small feat for dance music in the howling maw of 2017."
The 405,Every Country's Sun,75,"These aren't bad songs. They're very good songs that narrowly miss being great, mainly because they rush or nix the endings."
The 405,Orbit,80,"Not only does Orbit not overstay its welcome, it leaves you wanting more."
The 405,American Dream,90,"Each song compulsively and unabashedly recalls fragments from their oeuvre but when unified these fragments are cleaner, more assured, and more essential, than possibly anything they've thrown at us before. From head to toe, front to back, it bangs; but more importantly, it actually has something new to say."
The 405,Orc,75,Orc is another immensely satisfying offering from one of underground rock's modern heroes.
The 405,Villains,70,"The album is definitely progress, but maybe not as much progress as those of us eagerly awaiting new music were hoping for."
The 405,The Echo of Pleasure,40,"Whether it's their brutal attempt at gloomy chamber pop on 'My Only', their embarrassingly direct ripoff of a My Bloody Valentine track on 'Anymore', or their goofy, oddly timed guitar licks on 'The Garret', The Echo of Pleasure results in being an incredibly vague arena rock statement, one that's hopelessly gasping for life (and critical acclaim). As Berman's vocals have clearly aged, so have his songwriting abilities."
The 405,A Deeper Understanding,90,"He has further upgraded, re-geared and honed the sound The War On Drugs have been working towards, taking the style and vision of 80s rock titans and updating it to something that sounds truly modern, but with that nostalgic haze."
The 405,Who Told You To Think?,85,"He brings a force with him that can't be found on any previous release of his, and if his brilliance hasn't swayed your take on him in the past, Who Told You To Think?! is an extremely attentive and translucent entry-point into the modern philosophies and ideals of one of the best emcees of this generation."
The 405,Holiday Destination,85,"Holiday Destination is musically rich, but its greatest triumph is its concord of convenience and intellect."
The 405,TFCF,75,"The mix of hollow percussion, melancholy synth drone and further bird sounds on 'Crying Fountain' add up to a conclusion that seems to aim for open-endedness, but is mostly just half-hearted. This phoning-in is concerning, but the other eight tracks are as good and as interesting as ever."
The 405,Dark Days + Canap’©s,80,"Dark Days + Canap’©s is quite simply Ghostpoet's most accomplished record to date. As lyrically smart as his debut, and building on three albums' worth of musical experimentation, it feels like Ejimiwe has finally found his niche."
The 405,Science Fiction,100,"As an approximation of the band's legacy and a reckoning with Lacey's vocation of confessionalism, this record feels made for them. Science Fiction feels like an Event, similar to the releases of To Pimp a Butterfly and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy."
The 405,A Fever Dream,95,"They can sneak serious explorations of mental health, of the rise of ISIS, of the political machinations that erode the human connections between us, past their listeners because they have wrapped these high-minded concerns up in a package of eminently re-listenable, deliriously creative pop tunes."
The 405,Painted Ruins,75,"Painted Ruins is the result, a natural, unhindered expression, an album made for the audience they already have."
The 405,Althaea,80,"Perhaps the relentless vitality and vibrancy of their sound might not be welcoming to all listeners, but for any willing to take the plunge into Althaea, there's a whole alternate realm to be explored."
The 405,Good Time [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack],75,The most exciting thing about the soundtrack for Good Time is just how kinetic it is.
DJ Booth,Live from the Underground,80,"Ultimately, Live From the Underground may not be K.R.I.T.'s best album yet, for more that'd be ReturnOf4Eva, but that's like saying Michael Jordan's fourth championship was the ""best"" of his six titles."
DJ Booth,Control System,80,A few days of repeat spins now have revealed the album to have more depth and sustainability than I first suspected.
DJ Booth,R.A.P. Music,80,R.A.P. Music sounds like exactly no other album to come out this year.
DJ Booth,Strange Clouds,80,"Strange Clouds isn't perhaps as thrilling as Adventures, mostly because the thrill of the unknown is gone, but B.o.B.'s second album is superior in almost every respect."
DJ Booth,New Life,70,"While there's nothing revolutionary here, New Life is undoubtedly the work of a woman who's supremely comfortable in her own skin and own music."
DJ Booth,"The OF Tape, Vol. 2",60,"The tracks do not really flow into each other or sound good in sequence, but individually some records do shine."
DJ Booth,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,50,"Here both the production and Nicki's delivery border on absurdist theater, at one point devolving into Nicki literally making noises."
DJ Booth,4eva N A Day,90,K.R.I.T.'s created another album that will stand the test of time with 4EvaNaDay.
DJ Booth,WZRD,60,It has to be said though that the places where WZRD struggles most are the places where Dot and Cudi leave their hybrid sweet spot and try to go straight rock.
DJ Booth,All of Me,70,"This is an album you play during a lazy Sunday afternoon, an album you reach for during a long road-trip, and in a way that's far more valuable than the month's new hottest thing."
DJ Booth,Breakfast,70,"Chiddy Bang is the sound of the younger generation, which is to say that they sound like whatever they feel like at the time, and their debut album Breakfast proves it."
DJ Booth,Careless World: Rise of the Last King,70,"Beyond his mic skills, King also hints at Tyga's more seriously minded side, a side that surfaces again and again throughout the album."
DJ Booth,More Beautiful Than Silence [EP],60,"The young Somalian is far from the first artist to have to figure out ""their"" sound while sweating under the spotlight, and by the sound of Silence he's still figuring things out."
DJ Booth,Vodka & Ayahuasca,70,"Ultimately V&A is an album that presents a fearlessly original and coherent, if distorted, vision, something that's become an endangered species in the age of the hit single."
DJ Booth,Habits & Contradictions,70,"It may have its moments of aggression, but ultimately Habits & Contradictions is often a more quiet and thoughtful album."
DJ Booth,TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition,80,"The point is that despite the delays and false starts and question marks, ultimately Young Jeezy has continued an impressively consistent run of quality albums."
DJ Booth,The  Dreamer/The Believer,90,Together the two vets have created a work that's worthy of some serious recognition.
DJ Booth,Mac and Devin Go to High School [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack],60,The simple truth is this is the kind of music you're best off not thinking too much about.
DJ Booth,Lioness: Hidden Treasures,60,"Her talent and voice makes up for the fact that Lioness isn't really an album, but more like a collection of unfinished business."
DJ Booth,Undun,90,"undun clocks in at well under an hour, Questlove said he wants it to be ""ADD proof"", a running time that also magnifies the importance of the third of the album that's purely instrumental. It's on these vocal-free tracks that The Roots truly show what they're capable of."
DJ Booth,"Love + Rockets, Vol. 1: The Transformation",80,"Love and Rockets is a chance for hip hop to transform back to its roots; the real, musical, easy to listen to simple beats and lyrics that we all grew to love."
DJ Booth,My Life II...The Journey Continues (Act 1),70,I don't think My Life II in and of itself will go down as one of Mary's best albums; for all its quality it just doesn't have the focus and vision of a classic and occasionally seems to pander to the hot house/techno/club trend.
DJ Booth,Radioactive,80,Radioactive [is] simultaneously the most and least mainstream friendly album of the year. It's a seeming contradiction that only someone who was supremely confident in their identity as an artist could pull off.
DJ Booth,Camp,80,"Gambino's strength is also his weakness. As a TV writer and a comedian he's naturally focused on punchlines and creating moments, which at his best is enormously entertaining and at the worst forced"
DJ Booth,Talk That Talk,70,"Talk That Talk is both a sharp departure from her dark, rock-infused last two albums Rated R and Loud and a more easily enjoyable work."
DJ Booth,Take Care,80,"We're still a long way from a classic, but Take Care once again proves that he's just too good to disappear anytime soon."
DJ Booth,Blue Slide Park,80,You know that breathless feeling you had when you ran from the cops after they broke up a house party? This album is that feeling in musical form.
DJ Booth,Fear of God II: Let Us Pray [EP],60,"Most of Fear of God feels like detached, competent, common-denominator, major-label hip-hop, which would be fine if we weren't already aware what he's capable of."
DJ Booth,Ambition,70,"The overall result is an album that's easily enjoyable, but not particularly interesting."
DJ Booth,The Wonder Years,70,"9th's created an album that slowly backs away from the bigger, heavily soulful tracks he's best known for and delivers some more subtle, softer work."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Street Halo,91,"The six tracks divided evenly between his 20-minute 2011 return and his 30-minute 2012 stride forward, cohere almost seamlessly as the album they become when you don't have to turn any plastic over."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Celebration Rock,91,"Kind of heartwarming that it's still possible for a young band to rock out with palpable joy about the pleasures, terrors, and life lessons of the road."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Onwards to the Wall [EP],91,The placeholder EP is blunter and slighter than the album.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Worship,91,"Sonically, it's dynamite."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Go! Pop! Bang!,83,"Finally we've reached a tipping point resembling the riot grrrl moment of the early '90s, one in which every feisty hip-hop soprano has a you-go-illygirl edge on her notebook-toting male competitors."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),1991 [EP],100,"Quick-tongued, lascivious, catchy, and delighted with itself, there hasn't been a more pleasurable record all year and probably won't be&#8209;-not even by her."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The Dreamer,83,As usual the songs come clear eventually.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Americana,100,"In vivid contrast to the sanctimonious musicianly overkill of Springsteen's Pete Seeger tribute, Young's overkill leads with its middle finger by ignoring the catchiest tune of the 19th century, the traditional melody of ""Oh Susannah."""
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Seefeel,83,The gears that never quite mesh in this disquieting but hardly apocalyptic industrial ambient may be metal and may be plastic but are probably both.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Back on Time,91,"For once drum'n'bass's impossible Conlon Nancarrow beats, which Plug does pretty well with on those EPs, are the bed where the real music crinkles, crashes, chimes, swoops, swells, squiggles, gurgles, cracks wise, and just generally hooks you."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Blunderbuss,91,White's nominal solo debut is as striking sonically as any album he's ever authorized.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Folila,91,"This never takes off the way Welcome to Mali did. But it does hang in there, and rewards attention."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Urban Turban: The Singhles Club,83,"Several [guest singers] distinguish themselves&#8209;-SoKo all breathy, Lorraine nice and rough&#8209;-as does (Tjinder) Singh, changing up the rhythms as he ""milks"" his usual tiny store of melody."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Bloom,91,"Countering the depressive undertow, that form is both a spiritual triumph and the aural equivalent of Jesus and Mary Chain frosting a birthday cake."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The Only Place,83,The chirpy opener about fun in the sun is a feint&#8209;-the lyrics that follow are so depressive that the consistent cheer and conservatism of the tunes is like some perverse minimalist art move.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),The Money Store,91,"Excoriating as Burnett and Hill are, the real abrasive is Flatlander."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Locked Down,100,"With one or two exceptions, this CD never lets up, epitomizing his biz-wise mastery of rhumba boogie and the second line. The two pop hits lead. The gris-gris tracks are songs not shtick."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Europe,91,"Though her tempos have slowed half a turn, reducing the twee factor if that was a problem for you, her melodies are still very much there and her lyrics are sharp throughout."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,91,"If you enjoy contemporary pop whose market-tested blare offends both rockist philistines and IDM aesthetes, her second album is a worthwhile investment."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Between the Times and the Tides,91,Just the album you'd hope from a thoughtful 56-year-old after his band of 30 years breaks up.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Older Than My Old Man Now,100,"After he goes down on his knees and prays, as he promises he will, this album will be Exhibit A on his application."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Beak and Claw [EP],91,"This one-off EP with singer-songwriter cum symphonist Sufjan Stevens and semiclassical drum'n'bassmaker Son Lux is different, because the primary function of his raps is to ground the beautiful musics his collaborators contribute."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Brighter,70,The beats are less brooding and more funky and propulsive on Brighter while maintaining their presence and quirkiness under their ominous lyrics.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),4eva N A Day,91,"Almost every soulful track grew on me, with the clincher ""Down & Out,"" one of his periodic explanations of why sometimes he sips and smokes instead of trying yet again."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Father Creeper,100,"The music suits because it's also dissociated&#8209;-beaty enough to keep your foot tapping and your subconscious involved, but devoid of the escapist joy that is the miracle of so much Afropop produced from equally horrendous daily struggles."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Cosmogramma,91,"Part of its delight is how naturally the disparate parts fit together, but another part is how they add up to phantasmagoria if you let your attention wander (and don't be a tight-ass&#8209;-you should)."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),MDNA,91,Play loud. She's smart and she's proud.
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Wrecking Ball,91,"It's protest music, damn right about moral abstractions rather than those finely limned characters good little aesthetes get gooey about, and for me a cathartic up."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Some Girls [Deluxe Edition],91,"Where the regular album is musically quirky and lyrically either risky (""Some Girls,"" ""Far Away Eyes"") or generalized (""Respectable,"" ""Beast of Burden,"" damn right ""When the Whip Comes Down""), the bonus disc is musically classic-Stones and lyrically small-scale."
Expert Witness (MSN Music),Love at the Bottom of the Sea,91,"These 15 song-puzzles in 34:20 are sophisticated amusements all, although often the amusement is attenuated and one I get bored with before half its 2:38 is over."
Kerrang!,WYW,80,"A typically obdurate outing from an always captivating contributor. [15 Apr 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Every Where Is Some Where,60,"Challenging, but intriguing. [15 Apr 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,More Scared of You than You Are of Me,100,"A truly first-class record and establishing their place art the top-tier of the genre. Its choruses are huge, its lyrics are every bit as chant-able as they are poignant, its energy is relentless. [15 Apr 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Coming Home,60,"It's an amalgamation of what they've done before but without the rapping, or hardcore, and with the pop dial turned to 11. [15 Apr 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Swear I'm Good at This,80,"What saves these confessions from self-loathing is how Diet Cig dance the line between serious and funny wonderfully. [8 May 2017, p.66]"
Kerrang!,Fail You Again,80,"A record that's powered in equal parts by defiance and ambition. [18 Mar 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Bloodlust,80,"Murderous fantasy-fulfillment, it may be. But nobody does it better. [25 Mar 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Brood X,80,"Snarling, furious, smart, more please, Boss Hog. More. [1 Apr 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Emperor of Sand,80,"A mature, provocative and at times genuinely beautiful piece of work. [1 Apr 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Wired,80,"It's a record with an electric crackle, a halogen glow. [25 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Different Creatures,80,"If You're looking for something with ambition, swagger and feel-good power, Different Creatures is your beast. [25 Mar 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Voids,60,"They're never going to be the heaviest band in the world, but Minus The bear are at their strongest when they threaten to get their claws out. [25 Mar 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Heartless,100,"[A] glorious masterpiece. [11 Mar 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Millport,80,"Millport is a welcome postcard from a busman's holiday taken by a fine songwriter. [11 Mar 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Obituary,80,"Some of the best songs [Obituary] have penned, nearly 33 years after their inception. [18 Mar 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,The Haze,80,"The haze delivers both sleazy rock'n'roll and sugary glam-pop, with the band putting equal dedication into their myriad components to create a joyous whole.  [18 Mar 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,You're Not As _____ As You Think,80,"It's a beautiful, bruised patchwork: all fragile optimism and ebbing regret. [18 Mar 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,"Eternity, In Your Arms",100,"It is by turns beautiful and brash, driven and divine. [18 Mar 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,Wild Cat,80,"Danko Jones has plainly not lost his mojo. [11 Mar 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,The Grinding Wheel,60,"While the album does lose focus at times, loosening its initial invigorating grip, the jovial bounce of Let's All Go To Hades is a surefire live hit when you've had a few pints. [11 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Impressions,80,"Impressions is thrumming with big ideas, bigger choruses and is imbued with the pearly wisdom learned from rolling with life's punches. [4 Mar 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Sleeping Through the War,80,"All Them Witches have conjured fresh landmarks all their own. [18 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Atonement,80,"Easily besting 2013's Kingdom Of Conspiracy, this is dark and ugly death metal for ugly minds. [25 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,The Incessant,80,"The Incessant is an enraged punk album with the occasional sombre stupor slinked within. [18 Feb 2017, p.54]"
Kerrang!,Why Love Now,60,"Full of weirdness and with groove to spare, this is a fascinating collection. [25 Feb 2017, p.53]"
Kerrang!,Colliding by Design,80,"Alive with the freshness and vitality of rebirth, they've delivered 11 tracks that manage to bridge the vast airiness of their mid-'00s heyday and the poppy progression of here and now. [25 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Dumb Blood,80,"This may be the most punk record of 2017: possessing brains, balls and bags of tunes. [4 Feb 2017, p.51]"
Kerrang!,Safe in Sound,80,"This is a brave, bold and ambitious album, and the finest of Lower Than Atlantis' career so far. [4 Feb 2017, p.50]"
Kerrang!,The Trigger Complex,40,"Aside from brief moments in songs such as Satellites and Why Can't We Do It Again, the best thing about The Trigger Complex is its title. [11 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Kerrang!,Crossover Ministry,60,"It would be remiss not to point out that Iron Reagan are retreading familiar ground, but it would be churlish not to recognise that they do so with ferocious relish. [4 Feb 2017, p.52]"
Spin,Landfall,80,"Despite the resourcefulness of Kronos' contributions, though, Anderson is Landfall's most crucial actor and its saving grace; the humility, naturalism, and humor of her recitations justify the scale of the project."
Spin,What a Time to Be Alive,80,"The way What a Time to Be Alive zooms by, there are songs you might blink and miss if McCaughan weren't writing some of the most sharply worded lyrics of his career."
Spin,Always Ascending,70,"Despite such surface gloss, it's clear Franz Ferdinand are still finding their creative footing without McCarthy. The taut arrangements present on previous albums can occasionally give way to moody repetition ('The Academy Award') or sluggish tempos ('Slow Don't Kill Me Slow'), robbing the record of immediacy. This is a small quibble, however."
Spin,Crooked Shadows,50,"Crooked Shadows, their first album in nine years, folds the polished dynamics of contemporary pop into a hesitant, uneven collection of heartsongs that nonetheless ache and soar like vintage Dashboard."
Spin,Blood,40,Maintaining Rhye's style while enlivening it with non-synthesized instruments is the only real statement the album chooses to deliver--Blood is too gentle to telegraph much of anything concrete. Milosh's lyrics are vague mattresses of assonance on which he lays down impressions of emotion.
Spin,Phantom Thread [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack],80,"Greenwood's previous PTA scores provided feral atmosphere first and foremost, or in Inherent Vice's case, a convex take on classic Hollywood film noir incidental music. Phantom Thread's score, on the other hand, feels like another main character or storytelling voice in the film. Greenwood's abilities have never served one of Anderson's films better, or proved so integral to its power."
Spin,Snares Like a Haircut,80,"Besides restoring the muscle lacking on the emaciated An Object, the opening trio on Snares presents No Age as everything they've been (gritty, propulsive, atmospheric, a motorcycle taking on a sandstorm head-on) and the immediately accessible rawk band they've never been."
Spin,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,40,"Only a third of the album works. Obscure, seemingly unfinished, and nattering, this is Tune-Yards' weakest album to date at a moment when Garbus, distrusting her music's ability to explain itself, doesn't need the slings and arrows."
Spin,Ruins,80,"The new album's particular saving grace is its self-loathing streak, the sense that scales have fallen from eyes and that Stay Gold's nebulous disaffection has soured to regret."
Spin,Mania,60,"M A N I A takes similar chances [as 2009's Folie a Deux] to more mixed results, as Stump belts out absurdly verbose lyrics over glossy, overstuffed tracks. But the album's more experimental moments aren't necessarily its strong suit. ... M A N I A hits its stride in the second half, with a pair of tracks that toy with religious imagery and waltz tempos, 'Church' and 'Heaven's Gate.'"
Spin,The House,70,"You'll discover plenty of laconic beauty wherever you drop into The House, and it glimmers with the songful club music that made its predecessor great for getting ready to go out. But a profusion of digital-pastoral vocal settings makes it unlikely to displace Pool from constant shuffle rotation."
Spin,War & Leisure,80,"In lesser hands, all this weight could feel leaden. But Miguel remains a craftsman, and leisure gets its due."
Spin,Revival,30,The failures of his latest effort don't simply center on that side step from audacity to reckoning. It's in how that move has somehow left him struggling to write a listenable song.
Spin,Songs of Experience,60,"Songs of Experience, clicks into place more boldly than Songs of Innocence did three years ago. Tempos are alert, riffs punchy, melodies sharp. ...  It's also too bad the album's second half gets stuck in pensive midtempo mode and never recovers."
Spin,Utopia,90,"Utopia is full-on music-theater unlike anything Bj’_rk has yet attempted, and the rare tenth album by such an established artist to genuinely surprise with unforced and meaningful reinvention."
Spin,Rest,70,"Rest's intimacy contrasts Gainsbourg's personal reticence, and softens a storytelling void that might doom a lesser stylist."
Spin,The Animal Spirits,80,"Thanks to its polyrhythms and rich instrumental textures, The Animal Spirits is as likely to appeal to fans of experimental rock music (especially electro-tribal searchers like Animal Collective, Gang Gang Dance, Fuck Buttons, or Dan Deacon) as it is to those who regularly spend evenings at the club."
Spin,reputation,80,"Never has she sounded freer than she does here, a self-styled villain biting the forbidden fruit of gossip and letting its juices run down her neck."
Spin,Meaning of Life,50,"There are light nods to the timesŠ—”single 'Love So Soft' lightly updates Thankful's Christina Aguilera-penned 'Miss Independent' and Breakaway's 'Walk Away' with a half-time chorus, and tracks like 'Didn't I' and 'Heat' recalls Adele's collaborations with Max Martin. But the rest is stubbornly old-fashioned: sloughing off the flakiness of the millennial male while extolling the virtues of taking it slow and pushing for commitment."
Spin,Plunge,80,"Plunge feel vibrant and more alive. There are crucial moments on the album where Dreijer slows things down a bit to let everything sink in. Even on the quieter moments, however, the mood of the album is deeply human."
Spin,Turn Out the Lights,80,The final result is a balm to soothe well-trodden emotional frequencies.
Spin,Pacific Daydream,50,"It's disappointing, then, that this impulse of creative energy has resulted in a record that feels flat and strained."
Spin,Glasshouse,80,"Each song is immaculately crafted and sequenced, yet with this many ballads, they blur: a play continually in its eleventh hour."
Spin,Ken,80,"ken, Bejar's sparest album in terms of lyrical density and length in some time, is an aggressive, well-chiseled shift."
Spin,Lotta Sea Lice,80,"Lotta Sea Lice is strange, occasionally awkward, and easy to love. Like a good buddy movie, it's a little sentimental, and possessed of a deeper wisdom than its goofy premise initially lets on."
Spin,Masseduction,80,"Clark has carved out a space as a guitar hero in an era where that sort of thing is supposed to be over. That is impressive, even if the theatrics occasionally wear me out, and begin to feel like preludes for a visually dynamic live show.  I'm much more attracted to MASSEDUCTION's humbler moments, when you can better imagine the songs without the heavy arrangements."
Spin,Colors,80,"It's largely a plainspoken, cohesive work, closer in spirit to single-minded efforts like Morning Phases, Modern Guilt, or even Sea Change. And really, that's fine."
Spin,HEAVN,80,"HEAVN is musically spry and spiritually hefty at 41 minutes, the questioning half of a nationally fraught Q&A that's long deserved the answers, none of whom are currently running for president."
Spin,New Energy,80,"Like all of Four Tet's work, New Energy can be viewed as an addition to this unlikely canon, whose practitioners share a desire to remove a listener from their surroundings and bring them someplace higher, no matter the means."
Spin,Take Me Apart,80,"Kelela proudly stands within the genre's tradition. For the most part, she avoids making any grandstanding romantic or political statements, but Take Me Apart finds its purpose within the subdued complexities."
Paste Magazine,Light Information,75,"VanGaalen is very good at making eccentric, homespun indie-rock records, and with Light Information he has made yet another."
Paste Magazine,Shade,83,This 13 track set sees the band tapping back into that essential ingredients of their core sound.
Paste Magazine,Native Invader,71,"Native Invader is not one of Tori's sexier albums, nor is it as playful as she's demonstrated herself capable of being. But it's strong and unwavering in its commitment to being muse-driven and unafraid."
Paste Magazine,Hitchhiker,91,"If we could go back to a time where we had never heard these songs before, Hitchhiker would more than stand on its own as a brilliant piece of performance art. Stripped of the subsequent mythology or knowledge of what these songs would eventually become, each performance remains beautiful in its own right."
Paste Magazine,Sleep Well Beast,77,Sleep Well Beast is anything but complacent and it doesn't skew from the high-caliber rock and roll the band has been producing since day one.
Paste Magazine,Aytche,79,"Aytche is a deeply accessible, detail-rich drift that, like most great music in this vein, captivates with delicate layers that unfold further with repeated, careful listens."
Paste Magazine,Antisocialites,89,"For all its darker and uneasy lyrical content, this is still a record that begs to be blasted on road trips and at rooftop parties."
Paste Magazine,Dreaming in the Non-Dream,74,"The album feels more like an EP of stray tracks and sketches than a proper follow-up to Rarity. However you classify it, the highs here are undeniably high."
Paste Magazine,Elytral,76,"Credit Epworth with eschewing any formula for the sake of instant accommodation. Music this intriguing, this intense, speaks volumes on its own."
Paste Magazine,American Dream,91,"It's a beautiful work of art about aging, regret and an arduous search for meaning. It's an expansive record that explores a variety of sounds and themes, but it never feels confused or lost."
Paste Magazine,Every Country's Sun,73,"The band's new album, Every Country's Sun, doesn't necessarily represent a significant break from their norm, but it does offer a consistency that allows an easy flow from one track to another, all the while relying on sonics rather than singing to convey their passion and intents."
Paste Magazine,The Echo of Pleasure,83,"The album bursts with breezy and tight arrangements, meditative melodies, and beautifully poignant lyricism, making it a simultaneously boyish and mature exploration of love, longing and everything in-between."
Paste Magazine,Cost of Living,85,"What is most inspiring about Cost of Living is, whether they are addressing workers' rights, saving net neutrality, the white-cis-het hegemony or police brutality, among countless other topics to manage to fit into a 35-minute album, Downtown Boys stay angry, but are never pessimistic."
Paste Magazine,Still Striving [Mixtape],65,"Still Striving isn't groundbreaking, but it's a solid record. Ferg has the chops to be considered one of his generation's greats, but in terms of creative vision and originality, he's still not quite there."
Paste Magazine,Beast Epic,81,"A confident album from an artist who isn't afraid to merge the past and present, Sam Beam continues to audibly demonstrate why he's one of the most gifted songwriters of his time."
Paste Magazine,Villains,85,The evolution of Queens of the Stone Age has been slow and steady; and 20 years in the band still sounds amazingly energized.
Paste Magazine,Reservoir,77,"Writing powerful pop ballads about a failed platonic relationship, one sabotaged by distance, is part of what makes Reservoir stand out."
Paste Magazine,Orc,95,"The record is an absolutely evil stunner from front to back, top to bottom, head to toes and everywhere in between, and whips up the same kind of radiant, strange awe that the band's overdriven catalog has so generously perpetrated album after wicked album."
Paste Magazine,Painted Ruins,75,"The project is much more avant garde than their previous records, with their greater abundance of catchy hooks and hits. They find comfort in psychedelia, '70s folk and the simple things in life. Five albums into their career, Grizzly Bear show that they still know how to nail the dichotomy of beauty and tragedy."
Paste Magazine,S/T,80,The best compliment it can be given is that it doesn't sound like the band took a decade-long hiatus: Rainer Maria's songs feel as natural as anything else in the band's catalog.
Paste Magazine,A Deeper Understanding,72,"It is a strange alchemy afoot in their presentation; their affinities for pedestrian rock-lite can either be regarded as dismissable trash, or the most intensely gratifying thing you've ever heard, depending on which side of the bed you woke up on the day you hear it."
Paste Magazine,Althaea,81,"Althaea sets the tone for ambitious future work by Trailer Trash Tracys and provides a perfect soundtrack for in-between days like these, when music maintains a bridge to the lushness of summer as the melancholy of colder months begins to approach."
Paste Magazine,Not Dark Yet,88,"Not Dark Yet is too harrowing to pass for casual entertainment, and too good to ignore."
Paste Magazine,Elastic,84,These are disjointed diary entries that also happen to kick ass.
Paste Magazine,Rainbow,90,"Instead of dwelling on what isn't said on the record, she chooses to use her experiences to find the strength to move on. And so we get the most authentic Kesha album yet, and it's a triumph."
Paste Magazine,Popular Manipulations,79,"Popular Manipulations resembles a sunset that's far more than ordinary, the red sky at night before the darkness of the latest hours. It's not letting anyone down."
Paste Magazine,24-7 Rockstar Shit,64,"24-7 falters when it tries anything except balls-to-the-wall, though."
Paste Magazine,Cage Tropical,70,Cage Tropical is an elegant ghost that slips into your dreams and leaves you with only vague memories of the experience. That would be fine if Frankie weren't so close to doing something really haunting.
Paste Magazine,Collection,79,"Soccer Mommy mirrors the melancholic joy of Death Cab For Cutie with the emotive songwriting of Now, Now, reworking some older demos into mournful indie-pop that are introspective, yet intensely relatable."
Paste Magazine,Bandwagonesque,84,"Here's a skilled guy treating one of his favorite records with the utmost respect, and the results are predictably lovely. They may not be necessary or essential, but they are lovely. And that's what counts the most."
The Boston Phoenix,Researching the Blues,75,"Embracing those basics of simplistic pop, the kind that doesn't need to be over thought, works nearly all of the time, and though a little bit of depth to the proceedings would have been nice here and there, a robust hook will do just as well."
The Boston Phoenix,Instinct,63,[Their] strange blend of influences can be fascinating... but Instinct - clocking in at a bloated 14 tracks and 56 total minutes - runs out of gas way before reaching the finish line.
The Boston Phoenix,Life is Good,88,"On Life Is Good, he's lyrically and musically rich as he's been for years now."
The Boston Phoenix,C.A.R.,88,"On C.A.R., Cohn finds a loophole to get one of those rad concepts out of just that: a depressive who longs for suburban utopia."
The Boston Phoenix,Idea of Happiness,75,"Idea of Happiness never tries to re-imagine the concept of the summer album or, at the very least, the genre of synthpop."
The Boston Phoenix,Channel Orange,100,"Ocean brings substance with style, rather than style demanding to be considered substance."
The Boston Phoenix,Blur 21,100,"Teeming with B-sides, live tracks, and demos, much of it previously unreleased, 21 is both exhaustive and indispensable."
The Boston Phoenix,Icky Blossoms,50,"There just isn't much personality on display here: Icky Blossoms strive for in-your-face decadence, but most of the time, they sound like every other anonymous dance-pop act on the planet."
The Boston Phoenix,Major,75,"The many-splendored guitar blitz of Major rings in the return of good old-fashioned butt rock, but played to the squarely measured rhythms of '90s emo and Northwest indie stuff like Built To Spill."
The Boston Phoenix,Kin: Songs by Mary Karr & Rodney Crowell,88,"The writing is as crisp as the playing, ornate but without added contrivance, a credit to producer Joe Henry. A tuneful 10-song novel."
The Boston Phoenix,Unearth,75,"The British duo's second full-length in as many years mashes ghostly electro-pop tendencies with live instrumentation, empathetic orchestration, and tape-machine snippets, creating a world that is both compulsively listenable and eerily foreign."
The Boston Phoenix,Gossamer,88,The revelation in Gossamer is Angelakos's inner voice.
The Boston Phoenix,Never,63,"From moment to moment, Never's oddball quality can be a blessing, but it becomes more of a curse when the moment passes and there's little besides disparate pieces to hold onto."
The Boston Phoenix,Shrines,63,"Although the band's sonic stew isn't particularly remarkable or consistent (instrumentation oscillates between warm and comforting, and distant and anemic), their lyrics have a peculiar charm that keeps them alluring."
The Boston Phoenix,MTMTMK,88,"MTMTMK is infinitely more fascinating when it's pushing the envelope, mixing weirdness and darkness into the radiant multi-culti stew."
The Boston Phoenix,Handwritten,75,"With one foot rooted in the past, the band is yet pushing forward, with an album that promises longevity and, maybe, greatness."
The Boston Phoenix,Holograms,75,"It's nothing new, sure, but it's proof that mining from the past is a surefire way to keep things sounding familiar yet fresh."
The Boston Phoenix,Oshin,100,"Smith seems to struggle with whether he wants to write emotional pop songs or dark experimental soundscapes, but the push and pull between the two sentiments is ultimately gorgeous."
The Boston Phoenix,1991 [EP],100,"1991 is all about the bubble-popping lushness of ""Van Vogue"" and the hall-of-mirrors shimmer of ""Liquorice."" It's also about the summer, and showing more of Banks than just her breakout hit."
The Boston Phoenix,Confess,75,"Even if he's stuck in the past, Lewis's best songs feel timeless."
The Boston Phoenix,Manifest!,100,"With their debut full-length, Brooklyn pop quintet Friends have released the best pop album of the summer."
The Boston Phoenix,Swing Lo Magellan,75,When Longstreth uses his newfound focus to shake up his methods... the results are often startling.
The Boston Phoenix,Wild Peace,75,"[At times on Wild Peace] you might wonder if Echo Lake are merely a caricature of every previous shoegaze and dream-pop outfit. What saves the duo is how splendidly their iridescent sounds can evoke a moment, allowing listeners to lose themselves in the music."
The Boston Phoenix,Throw It to the Universe,75,"Throw It to the Universe, number six on the docket by the sextet, keeps pace with past efforts despite dragging at times."
The Boston Phoenix,The Tarnished Gold,88,"Cosmically in tune and harmony-rich, they excel in presenting their colorful, kaleidoscopic view of the world."
The Boston Phoenix,Slaughterhouse,88,"All of this should be terrible or grating, but because it kisses and licks every flaw and quirk with such purposeful gusto, the result is immensely entertaining and kind of magical."
The Boston Phoenix,Motion Sickness of Time Travel,88,"It's a refined sense of balance that sets her apart from Grouper and Julia Holter, artists to whom Evans is too often compared."
The Boston Phoenix,Oceania,100,The year's most outstanding rock album.
The Boston Phoenix,The Idler Wheel Is Wiser than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More than Ropes Will Ever Do,88,Her fourth album is arguably her funniest ... but also her leanest and most melodically daring.
The Boston Phoenix,Dopesmoker [Reissue],100,"Take this, the album's third legit release (which, by the way, sounds so balls you can practically hear the dank nugs), pop it in, turn out all the lights, face Mecca, and bow down."
Splendid,Belladonna,80,"This is Lanois's most accomplished solo recording in a decade, and in its finest moments it even eclipses For the Beauty of Wynona in terms of sheer goosebump-inducing musical soliloquy."
Splendid,The Understanding,40,There's nothing distinctive about it.
Splendid,Often Lie,80,It's a well-thought out and solidly executed effort by an artist who hasn't allowed himself to become set in his ways.
Splendid,La Foret,80,"In the best possible way, the album is a painful listening experience, forcing the listener into immediate and excruciating catharsis: you look into the eyes of a cold stranger, and see nothing but ugliness and painful regret."
Splendid,Underwater Cinematographer,90,It's hard to imagine a band coming along this year with a better or more enjoyable debut.
Splendid,Illinois,60,An expansive album that ultimately recycles itself.
Splendid,Free The Bees,70,"The band's greatest success is their ability to craft unassuming, enjoyable revival rock numbers with clever lyrics, recalling their musical forebears without ever descending to clich’©."
Splendid,USA (United State Of Atlanta),80,"United States of Atlanta is guilty of just about every modern hip-hop clich’© in the book... but its glimmering, capped-toothed, post-millennial party platform is a rousing success in spite of itself."
Splendid,Wikked Lil' Grrrls,10,"A towering monument to Esthero's overpowering sense of self satisfaction, this mess overstays its welcome and abuses whatever attention you're willing to spend on it. In short, it's not a career highlight."
Splendid,Every Kind Of Light,70,"While the lack of further experimentation in the songwriting becomes tiresome after a while, overall the band seems comfortable and happy to be playing together again."
Splendid,Humming By The Flowered Vine,100,"This is a wonderful album, full of heart, skill and intelligence, and sure to be recognized as a classic."
Splendid,Collaborations,40,O'Connor's lack of subtlety eventually grows tiring.
Splendid,Electrified,70,"In the process of refining their sound, Dressy Bessy appear to have sacrificed a little too much of their uniqueness."
Splendid,The World And Everything In It,70,So infectiously content are the Oranges that they can make even the most jaded listener bop his/her head or tap his/her foot to their power pop structures -- but this is also their downfall.
Splendid,Anniemal,70,"Annie has delivered a solid pop record that does a lot of things well, but -- and this is the important thing -- that's what we should expect from all of our pop records.... Anniemal isn't a high-water mark; it's a benchmark."
Splendid,Man-Made,90,Man-Made is among the finest collections of pop songs any of us will hear all year.
Splendid,Minimum-Maximum [Live],90,"Not just for followers, Minimum-Maximum is perfect for the old-school, drawing a new crowd of robot poppers and maybe convert a few disbelievers."
Splendid,JackInABox,50,"There's a lot to admire on Jackinabox, although it's ultimately less than spectacular and even occasionally embarrassing."
Splendid,Out West,30,"Gomez do nothing to rethink or reinvigorate their earlier recordings; in fact, when Out West's renditions are compared to the originals, the live versions sound dull and lifeless."
Splendid,A River Ain't Too Much To Love,80,"As much as it hurts to admit it, not everybody will get so much out of Smog's latest understated masterpiece."
Splendid,Everything Ecstatic,90,"Like Madlib or MF DOOM, Four Tet is at the crest of the electronica/hip-hop wave, forcing the genre's evolution into new realms and making everyone else look like amateurs in the process."
Splendid,A Certain Trigger,60,"Though Maximo Park has enough electricity to light Manhattan, there's a faint but inescapable whiff of calculation about them."
Splendid,Satan's Circus,40,"It's not necessarily a welcome change, as drugged-up, dubbed-out majesty has always been Fearless's stock-in-trade, but there's something oddly captivating about these dusky grooves and forlorn moods that makes it difficult to view the project as a failure."
Splendid,The Woods,40,"The least interesting, least engaging Sleater-Kinney album ever."
Splendid,Out Of Exile,40,"Middling music that shoots for epic and edgy, but takes far too few chances and falls short of its fans' expectations."
Splendid,Suit Yourself,70,"The impromptu feel is often charming and sometimes campy, but always sincere."
Splendid,Face The Truth,60,"While Face The Truth rarely presents a side of its creator that has not already been seen, loved, and cried over, it's a passable, even better-than-average album."
Splendid,And Everything Else,80,It's a perfect summer record.
Splendid,Sanddollars [EP],80,"Rarely has such a painfully awkward adolescence led to such B-boy-ish eloquence, but as he always has, Wolf makes fronting his own band look effortless."
Splendid,Wrath Of Circuits,80,"As with anything, some listeners will already have sickened of seeing the words ""dance"" and ""punk"" next to one another -- but for the rest of us, this is an excellent new chapter in one of the young century's most interesting musical trends."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Holiday,75,"More variety would help his cause, but Holiday is a graceful, emotionally affluent debut."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The Invisible Way,73,"The character of each new Low album is always a mystery until you hear it, so speculating on whether they're likely to continue working in this manner is pointless at this juncture, but it's good to know that ten albums in Low still have the ability to put together a stirring collection of songs."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The  Chronicles of Marnia,80,"Here she sounds more polished and pop-friendly than ever, largely thanks to some new additions and some smart subtractions."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Lines,80,"With Lines, Lynch has managed to trudge on ever closer to the boundary separating the two worlds that he calls home, though at least for now he's decidedly, satisfyingly settled on the side of the outr’©."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Sock It to Me,70,"Thematic speculation aside Green has managed, more simply to write a compelling collection of guitar pop songs."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The  False Alarms,72,"As commendable as their attempts at exploring different genre's are, Fol Chen do sound their best at their poppy moments."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Afraid of Heights,79,"On balance, it's what you'd expect from a Wavves record, hardly revelatory and moderately inconsistent, but packed full of reckless exuberance and fun, hyperkinetic jams to thrash around to that take only a couple of listens tops to get lodged firmly in your head."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Comedown Machine,62,"While Comedown Machine drags itself through a number of dead zones (most notably the dud pair of the title track and '50 50'), there are moments where they recapture some of what made them a great band."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Untogether,85,"It's not an album that immediately reveals itself, but when it lets you in it's hard to find your way out."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Chelsea Light Moving,77,the record does manage to impress despite being vaguely familiar and prone to flights of guitar fancy for no other reason than it can.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),House of Woo,77,House of Woo suggests an artist who's still coming into his own without being afraid to play chameleon at the DJ booth.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Muchacho,84,"It's rare to find a lyricist so honest and a vocalist so earnest, and when put into song it seems to Houck as if every word is vital and cathartic and necessary."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Outrun,79,"Outrun is exactly what it aspires to be: a fun retro-pop-dance album for those who like to drive fast through cities at night, perhaps behind a pair of sunglasses."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Nostalchic,75,"There are a couple of lesser tracks on Nostalchic and it's up for debate as to how well Howard sticks the landing on the LP format, but Lapalux is a singular talent and his debut is evidence of that even if the pieces don't all quite click neatly into place."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Crusher,69,"Despite the thimble of predictability or aural similarity, Wahlfeldt has accomplished in Crusher an interesting take on familiar sounds. It's too fuzzed out to just be post-punk, too sparse to just be a home-recorded take on his alt-rock idol."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Mala,73,On Mala he certainly could have done himself some favours by trimming away some lesser moments (particularly the pointless minute long 'Mala' or 'A Gain') but there's certainly a sense that's he gradually becoming more efficient with his song writing.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The New Life,79,"Girls Names does not dwell on the dourness, but conquers and transforms it into a solace--a sound resulting from some hallucinatory fever like a Max Ernst painting, realizing the shadowy dimension parallel to this existence."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The 20/20 Experience,85,Frank Ocean might have a gutsier pen gameŠ—–and Usher more moves and Miguel more sex appeal--but 20/20 is easier to fall into a groove with than any of the best contemporary pop/R&B albums out right now.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),The Next Day,80,There's a confidence exhibited here that's refreshing.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),New Moon,84,New Moon has extended the the group's realization of their own freedom.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Punk Authority [EP],81,Punk Authority sounds too accomplished to be the product of mere caprice.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Exai,84,"A tangled and glorious mess of aggressive glitches and clipped synths and stuttering beats and hints, shadows, and fragments of tunefulness."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Woman,86,"The duo retain a stripped down approach and it helps make each production choice and songwriting turn feel pondered and noteworthy, each track carving out its own identity and mood within a larger thematically consistent body."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),All My Love In Half Light,78,"Sweat's new album, All My Love In Half Light, follows from her debut, Mantic, utilizing the same setup albeit this time she sounds clearer, grander, and more in control of herself and the world she's creating."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Hi Beams,71,"Javelin's sound has in fact undergone distilled changes, but the result is still a fun album that once again brings up the question of what could be next for the duo."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),"100 Records, Vol. 3",68,"When viewed on its own, Vol. 3 is a pleasant, though fundamentally flawed, ending to Smith's musical journey."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Sudden Elevation,79,"Sudden Elevation is her first album entirely in English, and is the result of an escape to a seaside cottage to focus herself on her songs and the concept of the album itself, detailing the way tracks would ebb and flow. As a result she's created arguably her best work to date."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Cerulean Salt,86,"Lesser songwriters might stop there, and accept lyrical maturation as the only necessary step toward a sophomore effort, but Crutchfield also uses Cerulean Salt as a way to expand her sonic palette beyond the crackling acoustic guitar ballads that marked her previous work."
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),Clash the Truth,70,They're wisps and fragments that might leave you feeling nostalgic for the nostalgia that marked Payseur's past. If only the messages contained within the songs rang as true as the guitars.
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),A Long Way to Fall,68,"Neither cold enough to make a disquieting impression nor warm enough to connect with the listener the way the artist's own A Strangely Isolated Place or, hell, Amber did."
Prefix Magazine,Fifth Harmony,40,The majority of its ten tracks resemble either retreads of their former glories or listless attempts at Spotify-friendly R&B which rob them of any identity whatsoever.
Prefix Magazine,Beast Epic,65,"The album marks the return of that sharpness of perspective in Beam's songwriting. However, there are moments where the music--though the band plays together well--threatens to tip from spare into stale. It never quite gets there."
Prefix Magazine,A Deeper Understanding,85,"A Deeper Understanding is an epic, panoramic record, but its effect is an intimate, personal one. The way these song stretch out make them grand, but they still leave space for you, the listener."
Prefix Magazine,Villains,80,A lack of self-editing is the only real flaw on an album which proves that two decades into their career QOTSA are sounding fresher than ever.
Prefix Magazine,TFCF,75,"It can be a bleak listen at times, but for every scuffed-up shadow and turn to negative space, there's a song like 'No Tree No Branch' or the frenetic 'Coins in My Caged Fist' to pull you out."
Prefix Magazine,Painted Ruins,70,"They sometimes drift back to that comfortable space, and those moments make the record feel a bit longer than it is, but overall this is another interesting twist in the band's sound."
Prefix Magazine,Rainbow,80,"Rainbow is simply the record she needed to make. And at a time where most pop music is either designed by committee or drowning in beigeness, it's also the kind of individual and achingly honest record we needed to hear."
Prefix Magazine,Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960,70,"The one drawback to Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960 is that, with the exception of 'Light Blue', its d’©j’¾ vu nature makes it difficult to distinguish it from Thelonious Monk's landmark albums."
Prefix Magazine,Everything Now,60,"Everything Now doesn't stretch out so much as it spreads itself thin, which is why it won't ripple out like other Arcade Fire records. In the end, the band that made neighborhoods sound endless makes Everything into a cul-de-sac."
Prefix Magazine,Flower Boy,75,"Flower Boy is a fascinating, singular effort from Tyler, The Creator. He's crafted a record that finally measures up to a promise that has always been there."
Prefix Magazine,Lust for Life,80,"Although the reinvention teased before release never materializes, Lust for Life is still a return to form which should cement Del Rey's status as the queen of femme fatale pop."
Prefix Magazine,Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines,80,"The tensions on the second record take on new, fascinating layers as you go back to the perspective laid out on Born on a Gangster Star. The two also clash musically, sometimes echoing one another, sometimes conflicting. But both albums reward repeated listens."
Prefix Magazine,Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star,80,"Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star is a curious new entry for the group. It expands the space-age palate of Lese Majesty, but slips in the unique tunefulness of Black Up. And yet it doesn't quite sound like either, and--maybe unsurprisingly, at this point--it doesn't sound like any other record you'll hear this year."
Prefix Magazine,Out in the Storm,80,"Out in the Storm is a deeply impressive record, one that finds Crutchfield honing the strengths we knew she had, discovering new ones, and adding another strong record a rare sort of catalog--one that is consistent but unafraid to push for something new."
Prefix Magazine,Kaleidoscope EP,70,"It's encouraging to hear Coldplay finally tackle something timely and weighty, even if's taken 17 years for them to do so. Kaleidoscope's other two offerings aren't quite as essential, but are still worthy of taking a spot on one of the band's seven studio efforts."
Prefix Magazine,Something To Tell You,70,Something to Tell You is so impossibly infectious that they can just about get away with more of the same this time around.
Prefix Magazine,TLC,70,"Sure, it's nowhere in the same league as the seminal CrazySexyCool and the innovative concept album FanMail, and the absence of Left Eye--apart from a touching brief posthumous appearance on 'Interlude'--is still keenly felt. But there are still a handful of tracks here which can sit comfortably alongside their incredible mid-late 90s canon."
Prefix Magazine,"Funk Wav Bounces, Vol. 1",60,"Ultimately, Harris appears to have simply swapped one formula for another, and if there's to be a Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2 he will need to discover at least a few new tricks. ... [But] there are encouraging signs here that the Harris of old hasn't been entirely lost for good."
Prefix Magazine,Weather Diaries,65,"The best parts are worthy contributions to their catalog, and worth the price of admission here. But as a whole, Weather Diaries isn't the brilliant Ride return fans might hope for. Though there's enough here to suggest it could be a start, the preamble to the next great Ride record."
Prefix Magazine,Together At Last,70,"For Wilco fans, the songs here won't surprise. But the effectiveness of these performances, the intimacy of the quiet, and the small, new lights they shed on tunes they've long known all makes this a worthwhile record. It's a record of execution over ambition."
Prefix Magazine,Big Fish Theory,85,"This is a very different record from Summertime '06, both thematically and sonically, but it's no less incisive, challenging, or flat-out excellent."
Prefix Magazine,Crack-Up,70,"It is a record that tries to rise above the expectations created by the band's past success. In doing so, it loses sight of where their past success came from."
Prefix Magazine,Melodrama,85,"Still only 20 years old, Lorde could have been forgiven for floundering under the weight of expectation. Instead she's reasserted her status as today's ultimate alt-pop artist with a record that balances the contemporary with the classic in typically immaculate style."
Prefix Magazine,Witness,70,"While she may have slipped down the pecking order, Witness proves she's still a more interesting pop star than she's often given credit for."
Prefix Magazine,Capacity,80,"It shows a quick growth in confidence from the last record to this one, mostly leaving behind the moments that feel too quiet, too intimate to always connect to from the last record. Capacity is another strong record, and a brave step forward for Big Thief."
Prefix Magazine,Goths,85,Darnielle's lyrics never let nostalgia float off in the ether. There's a geography to Goths that adds complexity and specificity.
Prefix Magazine,You're Welcome,85,"While the album has the signature Wavves sound, the songwriting and production is taking on a sophistication that only comes with a progressing level of musical maturity."
Prefix Magazine,Slowdive,80,"With such a hooky, immediate, and yet complex record, let's hope it's not the final fade out."
Prefix Magazine,Hardcourage,80,"In taking a slower and more deliberate approach to his craft this time around, FaltyDL is responsible for one of the more purely enjoyable albums of the still-young year."
Prefix Magazine,Reflektor,95,"There is so, so much content, so beautifully and flawlessly presented that it can be baffling at times. The Suburbs, to many, was decade-defining music. Reflektor, I feel, through both content and design, will be artist-defining."
The Quietus,Need to Feel Your Love,80,"They're not just a crack musical unit--Kyle Seely and Matt Palmer, especially, have developed into a guitar duo to rival prime Thin Lizzy--the quintet feel like a great band-as-gang for our times. Morally upstanding without being dour or didactic, in control of their own image and destiny and capable of tuning to the key of life."
The Quietus,Soft Sounds From Another Planet,80,"Japanese Breakfast is turning into an artist with much to adore, unabashedly authentic but creating music that we can still all see a little bit of ourselves in."
The Quietus,How the West Was Won,70,"This album, then, is a gleeful surprise, and though it is debatable whether it would make the same sense for a listener coming to Perrett cold, for those who already know what to look for it is as gently persuasive as it is shyly moving."
The Quietus,Best of Crime Rock,80,"These 12 tracks serve as a bombastic backdrop for Svenonius' treatises on living the life of an anti-capitalist svengali; they're a guerrilla garage rock manifesto imbued with fever, fervour and soul."
The Quietus,Murder of the Universe,80,"While its episodic narrative veers off into realms of absurdity akin to standalone send-ups, it proves--especially after a repeated listen--a fun, texturally dense celebration of the possible, a showcase of real daring that has been the payoff of countless prog odysseys of yore, the perfectly bonkers lineage of which it so clearly stems."
The Quietus,The Singles,80,"Ultimately, though, as a collection that welcomes the near misses and the questionable latter-era caricaturing, The Singles is real and admirable testament to the full Can story."
The Quietus,Compassion,70,"Compassion is slightly less impenetrable and esoteric than Barnes' other albums, its emotions slightly more telegraphed. But it loses none of his power to enthral, disturb and enthuse."
The Quietus,Hug of Thunder,80,What has emerged is Broken Social Scene's best album.
The Quietus,TLC,50,"So, this is not an incredible album. But in the context TLC's legacy- as a goodbye tour to end one of the biggest girl groups of our time--there is still something touching here."
The Quietus,Dust,80,"It's an album that abounds with details but feels perfectly homogenous, and one can only wonder where Laurel Halo goes from here. It could be very interesting indeed."
The Quietus,Crack-Up,80,The whole album is a cabinet of curiosities to discover and decipher.
The Quietus,Big Fish Theory,90,"Vince Staples doesn't care for being labelled a rapper, perhaps, but in just ""being himself' he has created one of the finest exponents of the genre this year. Hip hop is punk, it's poetry, but also it's party music--Big Fish Theory is an outstanding album that potently shows all of these exquisite possibilities. What's more is, Staples makes it seem like the easiest thing in the world."
The Quietus,Together At Last,80,What this amounts to is a collection that's a good way in to the work of a songwriter whose output is three decades strong and a welcome addition to Tweedy's discography in its own right.
The Quietus,Samba,80,On Samba he has returned to uphold the majestic grace that made his father's music so compelling. Within the traditions of the music he is playing Tour’© continues to develop his own sound world.
The Quietus,Platinum Tips & Ice-Cream [Live],80,"Nadav Eisenman of Herrema's post-Trux bands RTX and Black Bananas does a commendable job without distilling any of the band's indomitable spirit or underlying power. ... The careful sequencing of the album, with the vinyl pressing clearly in mind, reminds me of the potent placing of tracks on Raw Power by Iggy & The Stooges."
The Quietus,Weather Diaries,80,"Going Blank Again was the sound of Ride discovering the sort of band they wanted to be, turning on the afterburners and leaving their contemporaries behind. Weather Diaries picks up the story from there. The forecast is bright--expect sunshine and the odd hurricane."
The Quietus,The Thin Black Duke,90,"By rights no group should be peaking after 30 years of making music together, yet that is the situation in which Oxbow find themselves. Will they ever transcend Thin Black Duke? Such are the ideas and attention to detail on this record, only a fool would bet against them."
The Quietus,Modern English Decoration,80,"There is nothing new here, nothing especially innovative either. It's just an album that consistently hits its target in a magnetic, mesmerizing way, and one that if you let it will swallow you whole."
The Quietus,Home Counties,80,A musically diverse affair yet still coherently Saint Etienne.
The Quietus,No Shape,80,Perhaps his most assured and confident album.
The Quietus,Nektyr,80,"Demen's debut album is worth listening to in its own right, regardless of any nostalgia for the 4AD sound. She takes a studied-sounding array of influences from contemporary ambient and drone, infusing them with a more operatic, vocalised melancholy."
The Quietus,Burials in Several Earths,70,"While there is the odd lapse into grisly power-riffing, the overall mood is sedate if haunted. It has the same effect as dormant memories or lingering dreams, seemingly placid and harmless but then suddenly coiling itself around you."
The Quietus,Modern Kosmology,80,"What makes Jane Weaver and Modern Kosmology such a joy is that it comes as sharp and welcome relief to so many of the serious and po-faced purveyors of cynically cosmic vibes. This is music that simultaneously celebrates and explores, that takes pop as its foundation and then builds a multi-layered space on it that welcomes one and all."
The Quietus,Rocket,80,"The raw and at times, ferocious navigation of the album soars in its earnest delivery and marks a career-defining release for (Sandy) Alex G."
The Quietus,World Spirituality Classics 1: The Ecstatic Music of Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda,80,"The 24-piece choir which accompanies most of the pieces here are a lightwave beam keeping the listener afloat, yet it's Coltrane's own vocals which resonate the most deeply."
The Quietus,Play What They Want,80,With Play What They Like Colpitts and Man Forever have crafted something truly unique: a spiritual jazz album for agnostics.
The Quietus,1000 Can Die,80,"It's wonderful stuff, centred on Ayisoba's signature instrument, a two-stringed lute-type contraption called a kologo. Obviously limited in its sonic scope, our dude provides rhythm and melody lines alike to hypnotic and strangely groovy effect."
The Quietus,A Kind Revolution,80,"So while the production isn't as in-your-face as before, the flourishes that characterised those releases are here deployed to subtle effect on an album that's only too happy to explore a variety of stylistic routes including blues, jazz, deep house and dub elements to make a surprisingly coherent and cohesive statement."
The Quietus,Black Origami,90,"Dark Energy was already a significant left turn for footwork and Black Origami is a leap into the future from that, with probably only '1%' (featuring Holly Herndon) from Black Origami sounding like anything on her first album."
The Quietus,Satan's Graffiti or God's Art?,80,"A m’©lange of harum scarum garage-psych, unabashed homage and carefully-crafted pop reprieve, it finds Black Lips at their most daring, exploratory and downright vital."
The A.V. Club,How Do You Spell Heaven,67,"How Do You Spell Heaven suffers from having a tad too much of Pollard's lone influence, and as a result, it's overloaded with the kind of mid-tempo filler that takes a few listens to really stand out. Even still, it's a uniformly enjoyable listen, one that's mostly upbeat."
The A.V. Club,Cost of Living,83,"Her message is crystal clear, as is the rest of Cost Of Living. Downtown Boys is determined to be the kind of band we need right now, delivering the kind of punk that that aims to change the world."
The A.V. Club,Cage Tropical,91,"Cage Tropical possesses darker dimensions and inspirations, driven by twinges of velocity and an unsettled vibe. This combination suits Rose well: Her music may have emerged from a period of great turmoil, but, in the process, she's found a new path forward."
The A.V. Club,Good Time [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack],83,"It's a masterful job of homage, andŠ—”as with Thief and Drive before it--all those pulsating synths and cavernous low tones give the film much of its swagger, and they promise to intensify your own, far less exciting commute as well."
The A.V. Club,Rainbow,83,"It's a bold, focused, universal statement about freedom--from self-hatred, from paralyzing internal conflicts, from gender expectations, from negative influences, and (especially) from other people's shit."
The A.V. Club,Bandwagonesque,83,"For fans of the original, Gibbard's Bandwagonesque should be a nice, unsurprising treat; for fans of Gibbard's who may not be familiar with the original's charms, hopefully it'll be a way in."
The A.V. Club,Hitchhiker,83,"For fans of Neil Young in the '70s--his pretty undeniable peak--this one is fantastic. Beyond that, it could easily serve as an introduction to a generation that hasn't heard his music."
The A.V. Club,Dead Cross,83,"Whereas many supergroup albums feel tired and humorless, Dead Cross is a lean hardcore record that drills eardrums like a nitrous-addled dentist."
The A.V. Club,Call It Love,67,"This is a record that plays it safe musically, even as it probes uncomfortable emotional states and difficult experiences."
The A.V. Club,Dark Matter,91,"Dark Matter is dense, complicated stuff, though it's also an engrossing display of pop theater."
The A.V. Club,Lust for Life,75,"While Del Rey's voice remains firmly at the forefront, the spare arrangements encourage listeners to fill in their own emotional blanks for once."
The A.V. Club,Paranormal,83,"Somewhat unexpectedly, Paranormal is even more intriguing when it delves into heavier territory."
The A.V. Club,Everything Now,75,"Everything Now could stand to be more disciplined, though its looseness is also a reminder of how Arcade Fire leaped past its indie-rock peers by being an honest-to-goodness hot, swinging combo, feeding off each other and the crowd. Building off those chops and that adulation, Win Butler and his mates developed a sound as ornate, ceremonial, and transcendent as a church service."
The A.V. Club,Flower Boy,91,"Flower Boy is the first time he's been equally as forthcoming in his actual music. His flow has tightened up, and for a man whose voice basically destined him for rap stardom, he's become even better at stretching his booming baritone into novel shapes, employing a plethora of flows."
The A.V. Club,A Black Mile to the Surface,50,"There's some beautiful songwriting here, but it's buried beneath the smudges of its producers."
The A.V. Club,New Facts Emerge,42,"It's not bad--it's certainly not an Ersatz GB, or Are You Are Missing Winner (though its half-assed cover art certainly comes close). But now that I've written it up, off it will go into the pile, never to be played."
The A.V. Club,Add Violence [EP],67,"Nothing on last year's Not The Actual Events approached the grabbiness of 'Less Than,' but that EP distributed its charms more evenly than Add Violence, which never tops its leadoff track."
The A.V. Club,Universal High,50,"At points, Universal High finds a hook and rides it somewhere new, but for the most part it's content to time-travel to safe harbors, layering clean, jazzy guitar over simple grooves or dabbling in yacht rock."
The A.V. Club,Eucalyptus,58,"While Eucalyptus is undoubtedly intriguing, it's only occasionally enjoyable as music."
The A.V. Club,Sacred Hearts Club,42,"Overall, Sacred Hearts Club also signals a return to Foster The People's more electronic origins, but not in the inventive way that was used on Torches. Rather, it comes off as hackneyed copy, full of the predictable EDM/trap beats that every other chart-topper has shoved in somewhere."
The A.V. Club,Mellow Waves,75,Don't let the lightness of Mellow Waves fool you; its pleasures are substantive and lingering.
The A.V. Club,"Times Infinity, Vol. 2",33,"Throughout, the album is marred by dated, slathered-on digital effects or chintzy, '70s romantic drama synth-strings, or laden with clunky refrains."
The A.V. Club,Lo Tom,75,"Sometimes quick-and-dirty is the way to go, and with just eight straightforward songs, Lo Tom does it really well. It's hard to say if anybody beyond the Bazan-devoted will jump on board--or even find a record like this--but his flock should be delighted."
The A.V. Club,Dear,67,"There are stray blasts of righteous melody, like the anthemic crescendos that erupt from the placid surface of 'Beyond.' But most of Dear's sonic earthquakes seem designed to rattle the bones, not catch the ears."
The A.V. Club,Soft Sounds From Another Planet,91,"While everything on Japanese Breakfast's proper sophomore effort isn't entirely fresh, and its structure is somewhat loose, there's a confidence and crispness to Soft Sounds that shows just how fully realized Zauner's formerly homemade experiments have become."
The A.V. Club,Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star,83,"Born On A Gangster Star zeroes in on Butler's abstract state-of-hip-hop lyrics, epitomized by the booming, beautiful 'Shine A Light.' Still, these delineations aren't exact. Both albums seem to circle each other like binary stars, feeding off of and justifying the other."
The A.V. Club,Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines,83,"Both albums create worlds unto themselves. The gauzy, sensual Quazarz Vs. The Jealous Machines highlights the duo's more melodic side, moving from lust and consummation to a film-noir spy flick, pursued by nebulous internet drones."
The A.V. Club,Need to Feel Your Love,75,"The latter song ['Meet Me In The Street'] sets the tone for the record, as it rails against the ugliness of privilege ('Silver spoon suckers headed for a fall / And justice for all') and encourages an uprising against authority. Equally galvanizing is 'Suffer Me,' a song about the Stonewall Riots, and 'Expect The Bayonet,' which is about marginalized groups banding together to fight oppression: 'If you don't give us the ballot / Expect the bayonet.'"
The A.V. Club,Out in the Storm,100,"Each Waxahatchee album has felt like a big step forward, and Out In The Storm feels like the biggest one yet."
The A.V. Club,A Walk With Love and Death,50,"Overall Love isn't arresting enough to draw listeners in without a visual component. Along with a handful of other Melvins albums, A Walk With Love & Death seems destined to be overshadowed by the band's stronger output."
No Ripcord,I Tell a Fly,50,"Hints of regularity are often dropped before being snatched away from you in vaudevillian style. There's an awful lot to be admired about Clementine's approach, but it's certainly not an easy listen."
No Ripcord,Colors,60,"Charging power-pop anthems like I'm So Free and Dear Life agree with his current stature as an elder statesman who can try to keep it cool, except that when he veers into strummy gloss pop (Up All Night, Square One) it makes him sound out of touch."
No Ripcord,Out of Range,80,"But the band is grounded in humility, always playing against each other with a drifting timbre that's inviting and likable. But tucked within their textural progressions lay deftly written songs that honor their long-lived inclination to remain emotionally and intellectually independent."
No Ripcord,Lotta Sea Lice,70,"With any other protagonists this project could become sickeningly twee, but Vile and Barnett deliver every lyric, no matter how ridiculous, with absolute sincerity. As they close with a stunning cover of Belly's Untogether, it's difficult to be cynical about something this utterly charming."
No Ripcord,Turn Out the Lights,100,"These are songs that you feel more than listen to. Everyone has encountered some sort of mental illness, addiction or crisis of faith, whether in your life or another's. Not only does Baker prove that you're not alone, but she finds a way to make it better."
No Ripcord,Screen Memories,70,"He propels the masses into an apocalyptic party with simple and inviting gestures, even if behind the songs lays an exhaustive perfectionist who's fully dedicated to his craft. That exhaustion does catch up with Maus as the quality of the songwriting loses its luster, especially during its second half, but his sharply quizzical thoughts do cohere into an involving whole."
No Ripcord,Always Foreign,70,"A large portion of Always Foreign focuses on building terse melodic post-rock suites (Faker), though their words are necessary and valued, and they emote them with a heartfelt directness that recalls their formative beginnings (Dillon and Her Son, Gram). This balancing act of moods can sometimes lend Always Foreign an air of indecision, though if the intent was to take it as majestic as it can be, then they remove any trace of subtlety on the album's rousing power ballad as if applying the handkerchief-in-hand progressive elements of Queensryche (Infinite Steve)."
No Ripcord,Plum,70,"While Wand's leap forward didn't live up to some of the expectations I'd had via 1000 Days, the light and engaging Charles De Gaulle and nicely-arranged harmonizing in Driving wouldn't exist if not for the band's efforts to do so with Plum."
No Ripcord,Bambino,70,"Bambino is a record that is kaleidoscopically colourful, staying in charge of a viciously artistic wall chart of sounds and turning it into something impressively cohesive. In the groovefest that is Need a Little Spider and the deliciously sleek Double Dutch, there are some downright bangers on here for good measure."
No Ripcord,Every Country's Sun,80,"A lot of this terminology may sound familiar to the Mogwai devoted, but Every Country's Sun does signal a change in attitude and confidence, and there's no more convincing argument than that."
No Ripcord,Love What Survives,80,"A notable cast of musicians, ranging from James Blake and King Krule to Micachu, impart their own idiosyncrasies, coming together to adopt a more avant-garde variant. But never does it hide the duo's own merits, as they embrace a more vibrant form of beat-driven electronica that also functions in a rock context with collaboration at its heart."
No Ripcord,Aromanticism,70,"Aromanticism is downright beautiful but is also too enamored with its sensual aura, which sometimes exposes his uneven vocal acrobatics."
No Ripcord,Ash,70,"Their willingness to embrace worldly influences--and infuse their own urbanity--into their arrangements is crucial with regards to enabling the spirited reveries to accommodate the twins' extrasensory wordplay, bringing a stability to the arbitrary grooves."
No Ripcord,Outrage! Is Now,30,"Outrage! Is Now is unequivocally uninspired, shelving almost all of the rawness that put the Toronto doublet on the map thirteen years ago. It's lyrically apathetic, and Jesse F. Keeler's basslines have lost all of their punishing nature."
No Ripcord,Hiss Spun,70,"Hiss Spun is the first record from Chelsea Wolfe that commits entirely to the more catastrophic elements of her repertoire, and the results are equal parts stunning and terrifying."
No Ripcord,Light Information,70,"There's a deferential tone to Light Information that suggests he's never really going to change his signature shtick, and even if we always know what to expect, it always feels like a warm return home from an always generous friend."
No Ripcord,Antisocialites,70,"Molly Rankin's vocals throughout the record compliment the soundscapes perfectly, fanning disappointment with hope whilst exercising a great deal of control--and an admirable lack of bias--over her ponderings."
No Ripcord,I Love You Like a Brother,80,"I Love You Like a Brother is the type of catchy, kinetic album that's natural and effortless."
No Ripcord,Masseduction,60,"There's the promise of another knockout. One that, unfortunately, takes the liberty of reshaping past half-baked ideas without really adding much flair to Clark's otherwise intriguing exploration of fame and femininity."
No Ripcord,Ogilala,80,"Ogilala is anything but musically overwrought, and the melodies do keep a haunting quality that elevates his distinct quivering voice."
No Ripcord,Willowbank,60,"At times it's as if the band is still trying to figure out the right temperament to base off of for the extent of a full-length album. The result is an uneven pairing of drive and control, and the latter tends to push them towards worn-out novelty with greater force."
No Ripcord,Visions of a Life,90,"Wolf Alice have come up with the goods again with their second LP, and in Ellie Rowsell they have a frontwoman who hypnotises and enthralls at will."
No Ripcord,Relatives in Descent,90,"With a sound that maintains relevancy in the modern age as the band keeps true to a form that's existed thirty-plus years, Protomartyr's Detroit Rock interpretation of post-punk seems to gain something with every album they produce, a sensibility that's somehow detectible but difficult to define or pinpoint."
No Ripcord,Earl Grey,70,"There are areas of the record where moments become a bit looser and less infectious, but generally this is a strong debut."
No Ripcord,A Deeper Understanding,60,"His lack of nuance from a lyrical standpoint is startling, to the point where it confuses one into thinking that it's profound since everything else is so carefully considered. It comes from a genuine place, sure, but his overly labored Reagan-era balladry rekindles a musical period that still sounds entirely dated."
No Ripcord,Popular Manipulations,70,"Themes of alienation and heartbreak are set against sweeping guitar hooks, handled with a well-studied attention to craft that takes cues from bands like Wolf Parade and Modest Mouse. A wise template to base their potent anthems on."
No Ripcord,Collection,70,Collection is a strong ermŠ—_ collection of cosy tracks that maintain the kind of candid inwardness that can sometimes be lost between the bedroom and the studio.
No Ripcord,TFCF,70,"TFCF is riddled with confusion and self-reflection, and it faithfully continues Liars' unconventional stride, though this time it had to affect him intimately and personally to take him there."
No Ripcord,Holiday Destination,80,"Holiday Destination is Shah's third LP, and is her most accomplished effort to date--superbly executed with an ability to make an austere backdrop insatiably compelling."
No Ripcord,Dark Days + Canap’©s,60,"He has created such a strong, affecting soundscape that for the most part of the record it is uncomfortable to listen to. Whether that is by design or not, Ejimiwe has administered a macabre marriage of sound and speak that are made for each other."
Playlouder,We Are The Pipettes,90,'We Are The Pipettes' is perfection.
Playlouder,Playtime Is Over,90,It's about the best a studio grime album can be.
Playlouder,I Created Disco,40,The problem is that I Created Disco goes on for nearly an hour and barely changes tack once.
Playlouder,Panic Prevention,30,"There are many more interesting artists out there doing the kind of thing Jamie does with more panache and originality with voices that don't make me want to throw myself under an underground train, but they're not from Wimbledon."
Playlouder,Those The Brokes,80,"It might be easy to criticise 'Those The Brokes' as a stab at busting through into the MOR mainstream, but it's fairer to see it as The Magic Numbers developing their expression while staying faithful to their core sound, and quiet charm."
Playlouder,An End Has A Start,100,"This album is fucking brilliant Š—– it made me want to cut my hair, paint the ceiling, fuck the postman and burn the disco down. So I did. Then I curled up in a corner, cried, and shat myself."
Playlouder,Our Love To Admire,100,"The band have colonised the rich turf at the intersection of meticulously structured mope-rock and free-flowing three-chord pop, where moments of resignation cosy up alongside twinkling hopes for the future like Winehouse to the sauce."
Playlouder,Cross,90,They've totally nailed it.
Playlouder,Goodbye,40,It was possible to ignore Schnauss' new age leanings previously but they're rammed home mercilessly here making too much of this album sound like Enya-period Sigur Ros.
Playlouder,Super Taranta!,90,"Yes, it's the relentless energy, humour and versatility which makes this record stand out and apparently their albums are merely incidental compared to their stunning live shows."
Playlouder,New Maps of Hell,70,"The album is closer to the thrash end of their style then the folk, and the music reflects the anger in the songs brilliantly."
Playlouder,Astronomy For Dogs,40,"Disappointing, frustrating and exhausting, 'Astronomy For Dogs' finds a band trying too hard to cram too much into one sitting."
Playlouder,Icky Thump,90,"As White Stripes albums go, 'Icky Thump' is a goodie, and there's no resting on of laurels either."
Playlouder,It's A Bit Complicated,90,"One trick pony's they may arguably be, but they've done the same trick twice and pulled it off."
Playlouder,Era Vulgaris,60,"In isolation you can imagine any of these songs may have appeared over the last 10 years giving a warm comforting feel, but listened in its entirety the effect is strangely soporific, a steady morphine drip running from start to end."
Playlouder,Riot!,70,"The good news is that for a bunch of brats they're well in control of the complex, riddling, labyrinthine structures that go toward making the perfect pop punk songs."
Playlouder,Someone To Drive You Home,80,"Thankfully, it's even better than expected."
Playlouder,Tromatic Reflexxions,90,"Anyone expecting any of the more experimental tangential qualities of the German group will be disappointed, as will anyone expecting intense lyrical workouts from Smith. Instead we have an extremely convincing whistlestop tour round current electronic music with a partially deranged, completely eccentric lexicographer raving brilliantly over the top."
Playlouder,"Eat Me, Drink Me",70,"There's nothing quite as immediate or fantastic as 'Disposable Teens' here, but the album on the whole is a triumph."
Playlouder,Excellent Italian Greyhound,70,Well as befits such a completely uncompromising visionary/awkward pain in the arse (delete one if you can be bothered) it veers between the preposterously awful 'Genuine Lullabelle' with its bewildering spoken word passages and the awesome wire taut assault of 'Be Prepared'.
Playlouder,Boxer,60,"A patchy, flawed effort."
Playlouder,Mirrored,100,"This is not just an album that can be appreciated by fans of the avant-garde, pop and rock alike but a genuine fuck you to the people claiming modern music has nowhere left to go."
Playlouder,It Won't Be Soon Before Long,0,"Listen to this record and you realise that by comparison, Robbie Williams does actually have some soul. And if that's not a damning indictment of one of the most execrable records you're likely to hear this decade, I don't know what is."
Playlouder,Light At The End Of The World,70,This is classic timeless pop.
Playlouder,Strange House,70,"Their brilliance lies in writing the crassest, most obvious, lowbrow hooks."
Playlouder,Release The Stars,60,"As a whole, the album feels less definite, less driven, than the 'WantŠ—_' albums, which is both a strength and a weakness."
Playlouder,Sky Blue Sky,40,If 2004's 'A Ghost Is Born' was an experimental step too far then 'Sky Blue Sky' finds a band regressing tamely in to Dad-rock. Wilco need to rediscover that middle ground that suits them so well.
Playlouder,Tio Bitar,80,"As good as 'Tio Bitar' is, it's actually a weaker album than 'Ta Det Lungt' in some respects."
Playlouder,Tales Don't Tell Themselves,10,"As concept albums go, this one wears very thin very quickly."
Playlouder,The Beatific Visions,90,One of the finest albums of the year.
Exclaim,There Is No Love in Fluorescent Light,90,"There Is No Love in Fluorescent Light is the sound of a band that know themselves. Stars speak to the truths we grapple with, and the internal nature of our emotional experiences. It's a gift to hear this realized."
Pitchfork,Weighing of the Heart,77,"With Weighing of the Heart, Iqbal adds another couple of strings to her bow, emerging as a pop auteur and songwriter of impressive emotional heft."
Pitchfork,Master of Puppets [Remastered & Expanded Edition],100,"The numerous early takes and rough demos have a diehard appeal (there's a reason Metallica has a dedicated archivist on their payroll), though the live recordings present a band going through its most monumental transition punctuated by monumental tragedy. Recording a masterpiece was the easy part. Genius does not appear out of thin air and Puppets was a culmination of Metallica's influences and forward direction, so yes, it will give you a more rounded sense of how a masterwork came to be."
Exclaim,Going Grey,80,"Certain synth melodies might be a tad too sugary for some, but they bolster the top-notch songwriting on Going Grey, and Sella's unique and unpredictable vocal phrasing keeps the proceedings distinctly Front Bottoms from start to finish."
Exclaim,Masseduction,80,"Clark promised us ""sex and drugs and sadness"" on MASSEDUCTION, and while that sounds like a recipe for clich’©d disaster, she kept her word and managed to fashion a totally refreshing take in the process."
Exclaim,Lotta Sea Lice,80,Lotta Sea Lice feels like two old friends getting together for coffee.
Exclaim,Lilies,70,"Less is more with Lilies--De Biasio goes big with a subdued sound, and the end result is luminous"
Exclaim,King of the Boogie [Craft] [Box Set],90,John Lee Hooker couldn't have asked for a better centenary.
Exclaim,Colors,70,"Colors is a breezy, tightly composed party-starter of a record that doesn't demand much of the listener, but gives back generously."
Exclaim,Carry Fire,70,"There is certainly plenty here to explore and enjoy on Carry Fire, but a sparser and more melodic approach next time out would be welcome."
Pitchfork,Radio Silence,67,"Kweli's flow can feel rushed and sticky, as though he can't articulate his thoughts as neatly as he can conjure them up. But his fans are loyal. Radio Silence will comfortably shore up the base."
Pitchfork,Everyday Is Christmas,58,"There's plenty Sia could do with an album entirely of Christmas originals, but too many are underwritten; there's more consistency in the art direction than the songwriting."
Pitchfork,The Visitor,67,"If Young's recent work has felt like a series of hard-headed dives into his pet obsessions--more interesting for simply existing than for actually listening to--then The Visitor is more all-encompassing, and as a result, more centered."
Pitchfork,Post Self,81,"Brisk, 47-minute runtime aside, Post Self is a daunting listen, as well as an essential one, even by Godflesh's sterling standards."
Pitchfork,Songs of Experience,53,"Despite the blatant bid to sound modish and rejuvenated, U2 cannot help in certain respects but sound the same."
Pitchfork,War & Leisure,81,"On War & Leisure, he sounds unconflicted and ready to rumble. The freedom he promises his lovers in his music extends to himself, and he's better than ever at just letting go."
Exclaim,Queens of the Breakers,90,This is a rich and compelling record that deserves and rewards your close attention.
Exclaim,New Energy,90,"Elaborating on the foundations that have propelled Four Tet through his 20-year career, Hebden allows the sonic palettes from records Pause and Rounds to bleed into textures born from transfigured field recordings and sonic artefacts that epitomize the producer's discography while refining his sonic identity."
Exclaim,Eternal Recurrence,70,"These sparse pieces beautifully combine elements of modern ambient production with flute, piano and chilly synths that feel anachronistically medieval in aspects of their harmonic construction. The effect is fascinating, and provides an evocative backdrop for Deradoorian's self-reflective poetic philosophical musings."
Exclaim,As You Were,60,"As convincing as Liam Gallagher is when he audaciously boasts that he's ""got the Midas touch"" early on in the album, As You Were doesn't ever quite turn to gold."
Exclaim,Wide Open,90,"On Wide Open, Weaves prove that they can flirt with convention without losing their edge."
Pitchfork,Morning After,76,"Morning After challenges listeners to assemble their own puzzle, pull fragments from it, and draw their own conclusions. Trust, aloneness, insecurity, hundreds of nights worth of feelings: dvsn puts them all in the air for you to grab at any moment."
Pitchfork,Blue Lips,71,"An explicit testament to Lo's chaotic love life, an unashamedly sexual and emotionally impactful piece of work. Lo ends up baring much more of her soul than her body."
Pitchfork,The Greatest Gift,72,"Though too scattered to stand alone, The Greatest Gift adds new dimension to Carrie & Lowell."
Pitchfork,Who Built the Moon?,71,"Who Built the Moon? feels like the sort of album where Noel spent way more time mapping out the sounds than writing the lyrics. But 'Keep on Reaching' whips up enough manic, soul-stomping gusto to forgive its obvious Stevie Wonder swipes ('Keep on reaching out for that higher ground'), while 'Be Careful What You Wish For' oozes enough creeping menace to elevate its title from clich’©d phrase to prophetic threat."
Pitchfork,Tokorats,50,"At times this sunny, heart-on-sleeve temperament seems harmless and even quite endearing. More often it simply grates: he's too precious, too twee."
Exclaim,Tenderness,70,"The upbeat Euro-tone with a dark edge that characterizes Tenderness is tidily executed, evocative and catchy to boot."
Exclaim,Nightbringers,90,"While the Black Dahlia Murder have always been an impressive band, Nightbringers finds them on top of their game and performing better than ever before. The album has elements of their earlier material, but present them with a polished and perfected vibe across the board."
Exclaim,Take Me Apart,90,"Take Me Apart is a subtle, sexy LP from a woman who knows what she wants, and clearly aims to write anthems for fans feeling the same way."
Exclaim,As You Please,50,"The thing with As You Please is that while it feels uneventful, it also seems like Citizen might be just on the edge of a breakthrough."
Exclaim,Willowbank,80,Willowbank is a mature album of exquisite beauty that confirms Yumi Zouma as masters of musical storytelling.
Pitchfork,Memory of a Cut Off Head,65,"His signature restlessness tends to enhance the Oh Sees' concussion-inducing material; for the past 10+ years, it's sometimes seemed like the faster Thee Oh Sees produce, the harder they hit. The approach doesn't work such wonders here."
Pitchfork,Soul of a Woman,80,"It's to her credit that it [final song, 'Call on God'] doesn't sound like a farewell. Instead, the songŠ—”the entire album, in fact--is a poignant statement of the determination that motivated her all along."
Pitchfork,Utopia,84,"At 72 minutes, this is the longest studio album of her career. Bj’_rk doesn't find love with three chords and the truth, she finds love through an endless interrogation of every note there is."
Pitchfork,Syre,51,"While there are some musical highlights--like the 8-bit ambience of the Ricky Eat Acid-produced title-track--the album is constantly in pursuit of a voice it never finds. Which highlight Smith's writing, some of the worst in rap this year. His lyrics are crass and half-baked and insulting to one's intelligence."
Pitchfork,Murderburgers,64,"Idle No More, released in 2013, was his first real adult album, with a real U.S. label and a sound that buffed away some of the rough edges but maintained that sense of the ridiculous. That charisma comes through on Murderburgers, his debut solo record and the first on his own Khannibalism Records (an imprint of Ernest Jenning Co.), although it's more muted and even more mature."
Pitchfork,Low in High School,57,"A few songs are some of Morrissey's most engaging, exciting work of the 21st century. Other songs get your attention for the wrong reasons. ... His political musings all arrive with a crushing lack of subtlety or nuance."
Pitchfork,Bajas Fresh,80,"The group balances tension and relaxation with the timing of a master storyteller. It's a talent Bitchin Bajas has shown on previous records, but here they've perfected it, instilling direction and purpose into what could easily be aimlessly pleasant music."
Exclaim,The Weather Station,90,"The Weather Station is Lindeman's loosest, most confident album yet, but it may also prove to be her most deeply psychological; she doesn't hold back."
Exclaim,The Kid,90,"Emotionally tactile and blossoming with feeling, The Kid is a stunning record that demands attention, absorption and meditation, two LPs rich with wisdom."
Exclaim,Rule 62,80,"B3, fiddle, accordion and, on a couple of cuts, saxophones result in a full sound, but the focus throughout is correctly placed on Rose's pure and retro-sounding vocals and well-constructed. ... Consistently strong."
Exclaim,Sterilize,80,"While the record doesn't necessarily break new ground, it succeeds in solidifying Unsane's rule as the kings of noise rock."
Exclaim,Ne
